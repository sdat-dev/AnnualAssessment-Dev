COVID pandemic while catastrophic  is also an opportunity for CFG to target funding for molecular assay development. The methods we currently use can be retooled to get us involved in infectious disease surveillance, metagenomics and areas for developing biomedical science and engineering","Q152":"The equipment at CFG is aging with some at 15-18 yrs. Our latest instrument is now 5 yrs old and going to be obsolete soon. Newer technologies allow for cost efficiencies and are gaining popularity. If we do not invest in capital equipment, we will loose our resourcefulness to the scientific community.\nWith the past RIFs that have been necessary to address the ongoing budget crises, it becomes harder to complete projects if a staff member is ill. Having a liquid handling station would help alleviate this and would also prevent current staff from work-related health issues like carpal tunnel","Q153":"Instrumentation upgrades to keep up with technology\nRobotics to alleviate load on human work force\nA more robust biostatistics and bioinformatics program at the university where we can tap in to. The data generated by our experiments is complex and deters faculty from doing them which in turn makes them less competitive in grant funding.","Q154":"More partnerships with other departments like Biology, Engineering\nMore collaborative ventures with neighboring area Institutions- we are already a regional resource\nMore partnerships with area biotechnology companies (fee for service, STTRs)","Q155":"We write a lot of support letters for faculty at the university but never find out if the grant was funded (unless we were listed for effort). It would be helpful to have a system where we could track this.\nIt would be helpful to have a better system to track invoice payments. Often our records are waiting for payments to show up on RF or State accounts\nIt would be good to have a small unit at the university that can refurbish/maintaine scientific equipment. The service contracts on our instruments are expensive but needed to validate the reliability of the complex experiments that are in themselves very expensive both in time and costs.","CreateNewFieldorChooseFromDropdown":"","TEST":"","FY2021Mission":"","FY2021Vision":"","FY2021Goal1":"Development of new genomic methods for transcriptomics and epitranscriptomics to enable

Dr. Friedman was officially appointed as Director on November 1, 2019. Since 2018, we had no official director. The COVID-19 pandemic put things on hold, but we have re-organized our leadership team and have set goals to fulfill this upcoming year.","Q81_6":"We have begun work on building an infrastructure to include undergraduate students of color in population-science research with our Research Associates.","Q91":"Our first priority is to increase our funding portfolio, with an emphasis on applying for grants in the Population Dynamics Branch (PDB) of NICHD\n\nExpanding funding in the latter agency will increase our ability to be successful in being funded by a future center grant from NICHD. This priority fits directly with the Strategic Plan’s goal, in the Research Excellence area, of increasing the ratio of faculty with research grants. To achieve this goal, we plan to invite a program officer from NICHD to discuss the funding priorities with our associates as well as others on campus. In addition, we will organize a meeting with our faculty associates from the School of Education, Sociology, the School of Public Health, and researchers at the New York State Department of Health to provide information to CSDA associates, graduate students, and the university community about datasets (restricted and non-restricted – like Upstate Kids, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, and NY State data) that could lead to funding opportunities for researchers in CSDA as well as across the university. We will measure our success by gauging the increase in applications for funding to NICHD and other funding agencies.","Q92":"We have encouraged our associates to apply for NICHD grants through the Population Dynamics Branch.  We also have renewed our application to maintain our access in our coldroom lab to the restricted data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. This access allows graduate students to work on PhDs using these data, which makes them more competitive on the job market.","Q93":"We have increased our applications to NICHD.","Q94":"","Q101":"Our second main priority is to forge linkages with other units on campus that do not know about CSDA but could potentially benefit from alignments with population-based researchers and from whom CSDA associates could benefit.\n\nNone of our CSDA associates are currently from the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security, and Cybersecurity (CEHC) or from the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. However, the research that is conducted in both units is focused on disasters and climate change, which has implications for the migration and the health and well-being of populations, two of the main foci of CSDA. Forging collaborations across programs is one of the main priorities of the Strategic Plan in the area of Research Excellence. To achieve this goal, we plan to hold a meeting with key researchers in CEHC and the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences and have short flash presentations so that all parties involved will get to know about each other’s current research interests. We will measure our success by gauging future collaborations sparked by this meeting and potentially others in the future.","Q102":"Because of the pandemic, we could not fulfill this goal.","Q103":"","Q104":"This year we are hosting a small colloquium series, and one of the presenters, Dr. Elizabeth Fussell, is the editor of Population and Environment.  She is engaged in climate-based population research focused on climate impacts on migration, which is a timely topic -- https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/15/magazine/climate-crisis-migration-america.html. Dr. Fussell has received funds from PDB at NICHD.\n\nWe would like to build the capacity of our Research Associates to easily access climate-based data to engage in demographic research. We have reached out twice to colleagues in CEHC with no response. We will reach out to Chris Thorncroft to get his input.","Q111":"Our third priority is to explore ways to attract students, particularly underrepresented minorities, to engage in population-based research, enhance student experiences of those already engaged in population-based research, and ultimately, through the former endeavors, grow a workforce to assist CSDA associates and others in the local community and government with their research. \n\nTo achieve this goal, we will target funding opportunities from the National Science Foundation (NSF) INCLUDES Planning Grants (https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505679) due on July 13, 2020 as well as NSF’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) due on August 26, 2020. With respect to the NSF INCLUDES program, Deedee Bennett from CEHC has acquired funding through this mechanism, and we will draw on her expertise in achieving this goal, which will also work well in fulfilling our goals to achieve priority 2 (described above). We will target StAR based funding to get short-term assistance in laying the groundwork for these proposals. The basis of these proposals will be to leverage our multidisciplinary research capacity to create a hub that will connect students to research opportunities at UAlbany, local and state governments, and private industry. CSDA will provide research training, networking, and professionalization opportunities in the area of population-based science as it relates to the data revolution that links the disciplines together. CSDA would position itself to become UAlbany’s core for statistical consulting and training across units and seek to generate funds from others seeking these services. Our initial success will be based upon our ability to acquire funding from NSF.","Q112":"We have acquired a successful application to the NSF REU from another institution.  To be competitive, we need to have a track record in working with undergraduates.  At the end of this reporting period (6/30/20) we advertised positions in CSDA via the work-study program to achieve this goal.","Q113":"","Q114":"We are continuing to work towards the goal of applying for an NSF REU next year.  We are gathering information on all of our associates who are working on research with undergraduates, and we will hold meetings with associates who are interested in working on this NSF REU initiatve.","Q121":"One of our other priorities is to maintain connections with other population-based research centers in New York State and elsewhere. CSDA and the School of Public Health at Albany have partnered with Cornell and Syracuse Universities in participating annually in an Upstate Population conference. We will continue to engage in this endeavor because it facilitates connections with neighboring research universities and promotes collaborations that can lead to extramural funding. CSDA will also continue to be a member of the Association of Population Centers (APC) and participate in APC annual meetings. Currently, there is an initiative among centers in APC to work with each other on an NIH-sponsored training grant. CSDA is engaged in this endeavor. Samantha Friedman will be the Primary Leader on this initiative and will represent CSDA at the APC meeting as well as the Upstate Population conference.","Q122":"Several CSDA associates participated in the Upstate Population conference last fall.  We have also participated in APC meetings.  We are involved in an NIH R25 training grant, called NextGenPop, that is being submitted on 9/25/20, although we are not a primary sponsor.","Q123":"We are involved in an NIH R25 training grant, called NextGenPop, that is being submitted on 9/25/20, although we are not a primary sponsor.  The first funding cycle will involve five population centers, including Cornell. We are partnering with Cornell to recruit undergraduates from UAlbany, and we will participate in the summer training program there if this is funded.  By working closely with Cornell, we hope to be a main center in the next five-year grant cycle.  \n\nCSDA Associate Ben Shaw just got funding for the Center for Aging and Policy Studies (CAPS), which is an outgrowth of our collaborations with Cornell and Syracuse.  The focus of CAPS is on aging, but it will benefit CSDA associates by facilitating collaboration across these three centers, all of which have expertise in demography.  I will serve on the Advisory Board of CAPS.","Q124":"","Q131":"Another priority is for CSDA to engage in its own Strategic Planning during the next year and develop its vision for the next five years so that its mission and goals are clearer, and inclusive of all associates, and aligned with the vision of the University. To this end, we will hold Executive Committee meetings to plan a retreat that we will hold within the next year (by November 2020), and within six months after the retreat, we will finalize a strategic plan document with our vision. Samantha Friedman will be the Primary Leader on this initiative.","Q132":"With the pandemic there was no way to hold a retreat.","Q133":"","Q134":"Last year's Executive Committee was too large and proved ineffective to make regular decisions about CSDA.  Over the summer we split the committee.  We now have seven people on the Executive Committee, and the other members will serve on the Advisory Board.  The Executive Committee is meeting monthly to establish this year's goals for CSDA.","Q141":"","Q142_1_1":"Appelton, Allison","Q142_1_2":"Associate Professor","Q142_1_3":"Epidemiology &

first priority is to increase our funding portfolio, with an emphasis on applying for grants in the Population Dynamics Branch (PDB) of NICHD","FY1920Action1":"Expanding funding in the latter agency will increase our ability to be successful in being funded by a future center grant from NICHD. This priority fits directly with the Strategic Plan’s goal, in the Research Excellence area, of increasing the ratio of faculty with research grants. To achieve this goal, we plan to invite a program officer from NICHD to discuss the funding priorities with our associates as well as others on campus. In addition, we will organize a meeting with our faculty associates from the School of Education, Sociology, the School of Public Health, and researchers at the New York State Department of Health to provide information to CSDA associates, graduate students, and the university community about datasets (restricted and non-restricted – like Upstate Kids, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, and NY State data) that could lead to funding opportunities for researchers in CSDA as well as across the university. We will measure our success by gauging the increase in applications for funding to NICHD and other funding agencies.","FY1920TimeFrame1":"November 2020November 2020","FY1920Goal2":"Our second main priority is to forge linkages with other units on campus that do not know about CSDA but could potentially benefit from alignments with population-based researchers and from whom CSDA associates could benefit.","FY1920Action2":"None of our CSDA associates are currently from the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security, and Cybersecurity (CEHC) or from the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. However, the research that is conducted in both units is focused on disasters and climate change, which has implications for the migration and the health and well-being of populations, two of the main foci of CSDA. Forging collaborations across programs is one of the main priorities of the Strategic Plan in the area of Research Excellence. To achieve this goal, we plan to hold a meeting with key researchers in CEHC and the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences and have short flash presentations so that all parties involved will get to know about each other’s current research interests. We will measure our success by gauging future collaborations sparked by this meeting and potentially others in the future.","FY1920TimeFrame2":"November 2020","FY1920Goal3":"Our third priority is to explore ways to attract students, particularly underrepresented minorities, to engage in population-based research, enhance student experiences of those already engaged in population-based research, and ultimately, through the former endeavors, grow a workforce to assist CSDA associates and others in the local community and government with their research.","FY1920Action3":"To achieve this goal, we will target funding opportunities from the National Science Foundation (NSF) INCLUDES Planning Grants (https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505679) due on July 13, 2020 as well as NSF’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) due on August 26, 2020. With respect to the NSF INCLUDES program, Deedee Bennett from CEHC has acquired funding through this mechanism, and we will draw on her expertise in achieving this goal, which will also work well in fulfilling our goals to achieve priority 2 (described above). We will target StAR based funding to get short-term assistance in laying the groundwork for these proposals. The basis of these proposals will be to leverage our multidisciplinary research capacity to create a hub that will connect students to research opportunities at UAlbany, local and state governments, and private industry. CSDA will provide research training, networking, and professionalization opportunities in the area of population-based science as it relates to the data revolution that links the disciplines together. CSDA would position itself to become UAlbany’s core for statistical consulting and training across units and seek to generate funds from others seeking these services. Our initial success will be based upon our ability to acquire funding from NSF.","FY1920TimeFrame3":"November 2021November 2021","FY1920Goal4":"One of our other priorities is to maintain connections with other population-based research centers in New York State and elsewhere. One of our other priorities is to maintain connections with other population-based research centers in New York State and elsewhere.","FY1920Action4":"CSDA and the School of Public Health at Albany have partnered with Cornell and Syracuse Universities in participating annually in an Upstate Population conference. We will continue to engage in this endeavor because it facilitates connections with neighboring research universities and promotes collaborations that can lead to extramural funding. CSDA will also continue to be a member of the Association of Population Centers (APC) and participate in APC annual meetings. Currently, there is an initiative among centers in APC to work with each other on an NIH-sponsored training grant. CSDA is engaged in this endeavor. Samantha Friedman will be the Primary Leader on this initiative and will represent CSDA at the APC meeting as well as the Upstate Population conference.","FY1920TimeFrame4":"ongoing","FY1920Goal5":"Another priority is for CSDA to engage in its own Strategic Planning during the next year and develop its vision for the next five years so that its mission and goals are clearer, and inclusive of all associates, and aligned with the vision of the University.","FY1920Action5":"To this end, we will hold Executive Committee meetings to plan a retreat that we will hold within the next year (by November 2020), and within six months after the retreat, we will finalize a strategic plan document with our vision.

Established in 1993, we pursue new ways to use technology to address practical problems of information management and service delivery in government. CTG UAlbany has collaborated with hundreds of domestic and international researchers on understanding and applying emerging technologies. At the same time, CTG UAlbany has worked with scores of local, state, federal, and international government bodies as a trusted advisor and facilitator of management and policy decisions to govern the use of new technologies as tools for public service transformation.","Q32":"Work with governments worldwide transforming public services through innovations in technology, policy and management.","Q41":"CTG UAlbany’s financial stability over its 26 years in service as an applied research Institute, has been based on its tenured and experienced faculty, researchers, professional administration and finance and project staff. CTG’s subject matter expertise has an ability to continue to build capacity and capability through its projects and research, while generating the necessary project revenues to support CTG’s operational expenses of over $550K annually.  These annually generated revenues allow CTG to support several project support positions, external UAlbany research faculty, graduate students and its programs or work through MOUs, revenue contracts and research agreements with partners both through the Research Foundation such as federal agencies, corporate sponsors, and international governments or through the University at Albany with state agencies, municipal and local governments, state authorities, and not for profits.   CTG’s FY 2019 PSR state allocation of $971,049  supported 12 FTE’s, during this  fiscal year CTG lost 2 PSR funded positons, one position to WFP committee review of Communications Manager denied for rehiring at $51,000 and the second position to the 15 % state reduction of Sr. Project Assistant at $49,993, totaling $100,993 in permanent state PSR funding.  CTG’s professional staff funded by the PSR allocation are engaged in CTG’s development of new programs and innovations, projects and research proposals, day to day operations, business development activities, academic and community engagement, and other related outreach and dissemination activities within the University and globally.   In 2019, CTG UAlbany conducted 8 Research Foundation sponsored projects and 3 state agency, local government, and not for profits projects simultaneously.  CTG UAlbany revenue generates annually, through various sources, to support CTG’s IFR operational expenditures which for FY 2019 totaled $510,581. CTG’s revenue generation through its various projects supports its annual operational budget of OTPS which includes the following expense categories of  facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, utilities), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, business travel, staff development, conferences, and any other non-PSR  expense needed to operate CTG UAlbany. CTG doesn’t receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget.  A unique aspect of CTG’s financial/business model relative to most academic departments and other research units; is that CTG not only relies on its traditional research funded projects, but has many state agency projects, under state MOUs and revenue contracts. These state projects are a part of the strategic business development and financial planning that is the necessary support our annual operational budget. Within this template provided, it doesn’t allow a place for CTG UAlbany to report those state MOUs and Revenue contracts pending, as is the case for pending submitted RF proposals. Therefore, the information is provided here in the narrative.  CTG has several MOUs pending with state agencies such as: 1. NYS BOE’s Future elections at $310,000, 2. NYS BOE Election Remediation Risk at $35,000, along with several other opportunities in the business development, additional work on the project with the United Arab Emirates estimated at an additional $40K and new work with the United Nations for a round two which is in the business development stages. Also, we are submitting a preliminary proposal to IMLS related focused on exploring the role of public libraries as intermediaries of innovation in local and regional contexts.","Q42_1_1":15,"Q42_1_2":1,"Q42_2_1":12.25,"Q42_2_2":0.25,"Q43_1":813839,"Q43_1_TEXT":"IFR 900309 RF IFR Revenue","Q43_2":191167,"Q43_2_TEXT":"IFR 910029 Project Revenue","Q43_3":0,"Q43_3_TEXT":"","Q51_1_1":2,"Q51_1_2":3,"Q51_1_4":1,"Q51_2_1":4,"Q51_2_2":5,"Q51_2_4":5,"Q52_1_1":1,"Q52_1_2":2,"Q52_1_4":1,"Q52_2_1":0,"Q52_2_2":3,"Q52_2_4":5,"Q53_1_1":"1","Q53_1_2":"1","Q53_2_1":"1","Q53_2_2":"0","Q54_1_1":"0","Q54_1_2":"0","Q54_2_1":"0","Q54_2_2":"0","Q61_1_1":"1","Q61_1_2":"2","Q61_2_1":"4","Q61_2_2":"2","Q61_3_1":"10","Q61_3_2":"27","Q62":"1.\tDemircioglu, M.

believe that working with local governments in the Capital Region, New York State, and throughout the country as a big opportunity to advance our research. There continues to be a federal, state, and industry focus on the area of smart cities/communities and investment of information and communication technologies (e.g. machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics) at the local government to help improve government operations and provide public services. Given our expertise and research interest in the policy, management, and technology dimensions of information and technology use by governments at all levels, CTG UAlbany can continue to make significant contributions in this area for next 1-5 years.   \nWe continue to see working with state agencies in New York and beyond as another big opportunity to advance our research. As state governments and individual state agencies try to modernize older and legacy information systems and adopt new data management and analysis techniques there is a lot of opportunity to apply CTG UAlbany's existing expertise and conduct new externally funded research in this area.\nWe are actively pursuing research project partnerships with faculty and professional researchers at CEHC and ASRC. We see a lot of opportunity to collaborate on policy, technology, and management issues in the emergency preparedness, homeland and cyber security, and weather domains and produce competitive and innovative research proposals.","Q152":"Due to professionals staff leaving and difficulty in rehiring due to current budget constraints, CTG UAlbany has seen a significant decrease in non faculty professional researchers who help manage and provide support to our research and other projects.

CTG UAlbany has collaborated with hundreds of domestic and international researchers on understanding and applying emerging technologies.

CTG’s subject matter expertise has an ability to continue to build capacity and capability through its projects and research, while generating the necessary project revenues to support CTG’s operational expenses of over $550K annually.  These annually generated revenues allow CTG to support several project support positions, external UAlbany research faculty, graduate students and its programs or work through MOUs, revenue contracts and research agreements with partners both through the Research Foundation such as federal agencies, corporate sponsors, and international governments or through the University at Albany with state agencies, municipal and local governments, state authorities, and not for profits.   CTG’s FY 2019 PSR state allocation of $971,049  supported 12 FTE’s, during this  fiscal year CTG lost 2 PSR funded positons, one position to WFP committee review of Communications Manager denied for rehiring at $51,000 and the second position to the 15 % state reduction of Sr. Project Assistant at $49,993, totaling $100,993 in permanent state PSR funding.  CTG’s professional staff funded by the PSR allocation are engaged in CTG’s development of new programs and innovations, projects and research proposals, day to day operations, business development activities, academic and community engagement, and other related outreach and dissemination activities within the University and globally.   In 2019, CTG UAlbany conducted 8 Research Foundation sponsored projects and 3 state agency, local government, and not for profits projects simultaneously.  CTG UAlbany revenue generates annually, through various sources, to support CTG’s IFR operational expenditures which for FY 2019 totaled $510,581. CTG’s revenue generation through its various projects supports its annual operational budget of OTPS which includes the following expense categories of  facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, utilities), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, business travel, staff development, conferences, and any other non-PSR  expense needed to operate CTG UAlbany. CTG doesn’t receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget.  A unique aspect of CTG’s financial/business model relative to most academic departments and other research units; is that CTG not only relies on its traditional research funded projects, but has many state agency projects, under state MOUs and revenue contracts. These state projects are a part of the strategic business development and financial planning that is the necessary support our annual operational budget. Within this template provided, it doesn’t allow a place for CTG UAlbany to report those state MOUs and Revenue contracts pending, as is the case for pending submitted RF proposals. Therefore, the information is provided here in the narrative.  CTG has several MOUs pending with state agencies such as: 1. NYS BOE’s Future elections at $310,000, 2. NYS BOE Election Remediation Risk at $35,000, along with several other opportunities in the business development, additional work on the project with the United Arab Emirates estimated at an additional $40K and new work with the United Nations for a round two which is in the business development stages. Also, we are submitting a preliminary proposal to IMLS related focused on exploring the role of public libraries as intermediaries of innovation in local and regional contexts.","Q42_1_1":15,"Q42_1_2":1,"Q42_2_1":12.25,"Q42_2_2":0.25,"Q51_1_1":2,"Q51_1_2":3,"Q51_1_4":1,"Q52_1_1":1,"Q52_1_2":2,"Q52_1_4":1,"Q53_1_1":"1","Q53_2_1":"1","Q54_1_1":"0","Q54_2_1":"0","Q55_1_1":"0","Q55_2_1":"2","Q55_3_1":"12","Q56_1_1":"1","Q56_2_1":"0","Q56_3_1":"0","Q56_4_1":"0","Q56_5_1":"0","Q56_6_1":"0","Q56_7_1":"0","Q57_1":"10","Q58_1_1":5,"Q58_1_2":30,"Q58_1_4":20,"Q58_1_5":0,"Q71":"Engage in innovative research and problem solving projects that address societal challenges","Q72":"Strategically plan for and submit research and other project proposals and contracts.","Q73":"Number of proposals and contracts submitted and awarded","Q74":"May 2021","Q75":"CTG Management Team","Q76":"Severity of federal and state budget cuts and therefore external funding available for externally funded research and projects.

IBL has the opportunity to participate in the fields of space weather, geology, biology and material science. This would increase our research utility as well as increase our revenues.","Q152":"The (IBL) is composed of several experimental systems that have a wide range of sizes and complexity. Each of these systems is comprised of a collection of both mechanical and electronic components, each with its own maintenance needs and operational service life. \n\nIn order for any manufacturing or experimental system to function efficiently and extend the operational service life, each component within that system requires a well thought out, and carefully adhered to maintenance schedule. However, not adhering to the maintenance regime can, and often does lead to the premature failure of components resulting in the need for expensive repair or replacement. Unexpected component failures lead to unscheduled down time leading to the expenditure of time and capital that could otherwise be utilized to extend the capabilities of the system. \n\nThe IBL has traditionally functioned with a contingent of personnel that ensured that the systems comprising the IBL had the care and scrutiny described above. The team consisted two to three technicians and engineers to maintain the systems and implement any upgrades or refits.  This staffing level was maintained for the forty plus years that the IBL had been in existence. \n\nThe current contingent consists of one technician and a part-time project manager. This staffing level is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the IBL and its continued operation, let alone expand and grow. As a result of the staffing shortfall, routine maintenance has been deferred resulting in unscheduled down time and avoidable expense. As a consequence, the time devoted to the unscheduled repairs further diminishes the time available for routine maintenance which leads to addition unscheduled downs. This spiraling degradation of the IBL’s capabilities over a decade of neglect has reached a near unsustainable level and needs to be addressed before the trend becomes unrecoverable. It goes without saying that if the day to day maintenance of the IBL systems are suffering, then the development and implementation of a Strategic Plan is impossible.\n \nThe current situation has already adversely affected research being performed at UAlbany as well as other Academic and Industrial affiliates. To continue on this path would eventually lead to a situation where the IBL would not be able to fulfill its Mission.","Q153":"The IBL requires at least one more additional full time Technician to help maintain the systems at the IBL. It would also benefit from a capital investment by the university to upgrade and modernize some of the aging components that are prone to failure. This would also lower our energy consumption which would be inline with the universities overall energy goals.","Q154":"Have a modernized and efficient, fully staffed facility.","Q155":"The IBL is a unique facility that has capabilities that are not available anywhere else in the world. Although it lies under ground and mostly unknown by the wider University population, its past impact on the development of our modern understanding of material science is profound. Moving forward, its expanded capabilities and practices should allow it to continue to contribute to our collective understanding of the universe in a very meaningful way. This of course is dependent on whether or not the IBL has the resources needed to first maintain, and then advance its capabilities.","CreateNewFieldorChooseFromDropdown":"","TEST":"","FY2021Mission":"","FY2021Vision":"","FY2021Goal1":"","FY2021Action1":"","FY2021Metric1":"","FY2021TimeFrame1":"","FY2021Goal2":"","FY2021Action2":"","FY2021Metric2":"","FY2021TimeFrame2":"","FY2021Goal3":"","FY2021Action3":"","FY2021Metric3":"","FY2021TimeFrame3":"","FY2021Goal4":"","FY2021Action4":"","FY2021Metric4":"","FY2021TimeFrame4":"","FY2021Goal5":"","FY2021Action5":"","FY2021Metric5":"","FY2021TimeFrame5":"","FY2021TargetFederalProposals":"0","FY2021TargetStateProposals":"0","FY2021TargetOtherProposals":"0","FY2021TargetFederalAwards":"0","FY2021TargetStateAwards":"0","FY2021TargetOtherAwards":"0","FY2021TargetLargeProposals":"","FY2021TargetLargeAwards":"","FY2021TargetSBIRProposals":"","FY2021TargetSBIRAwards":"","FY2021TargetBooks":"","FY2021TargetBookChapters":"","FY2021TargetPublications":"","FY2021TargetDisclosures":"","FY2021TargetPatentsApplications":"","FY2021TargetPatentsIssued":"","FY2021TargetPatentsLicensed":"","FY2021TargetLicensedExecuted":"","FY2021TargetLicensedRevenue":"","FY2021TargetStartups":"","FY2021TargetCONFERENCE":"","FY2021TargetUndergraduate":"0","FY2021TargetMaster":"0","FY2021TargetPhD":"0","FY2021TargetPostdoc":"0","QTEST":"","FY1920Mission":"","FY1920Goal1":"","FY1920Action1":"","FY1920TimeFrame1":"","FY1920Goal2":"","FY1920Action2":"","FY1920TimeFrame2":"","FY1920Goal3":"","FY1920Action3":"","FY1920TimeFrame3":"","FY1920Goal4":"","FY1920Action4":"","FY1920TimeFrame4":"","FY1920Goal5":"","FY1920Action5":"","FY1920TimeFrame5":"","FY1920TargetFederalProposals":"0","FY1920TargetStateProposals":"0","FY1920TargetOtherProposals":"0","FY1920TargetFederalAwards":"0","FY1920TargetStateAwards":"0","FY1920TargetOtherAwards":"0","FY1920TargetLargeProposals":"","FY1920TargetLargeAwards":"","FY1920TargetSBIRProposals":"","FY1920TargetSBIRAwards":"","FY1920TargetBooks":"","FY1920TargetBookChapters":"","FY1920TargetPublications":"","FY1920TargetDisclosures":"","FY1920TargetPatentsApplications":"","FY1920TargetPatentsIssued":"","FY1920TargetPatentsLicensed":"","FY1920TargetLicensedExecuted":"","FY1920TargetLicensedRevenue":"","FY1920TargetStartups":"","FY1920TargetCONFERENCE":"","FY1920TargetUndergraduate":"0","FY1920TargetMaster":"0","FY1920TargetPhD":"0","FY1920TargetPostdoc":"0","FY1920RFApplicationsandAwards":"https://livealbany-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/thuang3_albany_edu/EXlnEGIeXNVGrUIu2Oz9fyEBMdCP1CvHUBELnD5-5vkeog?e=c21h70","FY1920Vision":"","FY1920Metric1":"","Measurable:Numbersofpapers":"","FY1920Metric2":"","Measurable:Infrastructurefidelityandusefulness":"","FY1920Metric3":"","4\tMeasurable:funding/collaborationthroughpublic/privatepartnerships":"","5\tMeasurable:Numbersofpublicationsandpresentations":"","FY1920Metric4":"","FY1920Metric5":"","year":"FY1920","partners":[{"FullName":"Daniele
