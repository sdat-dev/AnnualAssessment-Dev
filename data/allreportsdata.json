When the funding comes through, CSDA will collaborate directly with Cornell in two ways: 1) recruit underrepresented UAlbany students to participate at the Cornell summer program; and 2) CSDA faculty will participate in training and mentoring the students at the summer program. By working with Cornell, in the future funding cycle, CSDA will be competitive to be a host site, which would bring significant visibility to UAlbany&#39;s diversity efforts and result in funding from PDB making CSDA competitive for center grant funding. CSDA partnered with the NYS project on COVID-19/MHD, CEMHD, and CURCE on a StAR proposal to develop an infrastructure here at UAlbany to engage underrepresented undergraduates in minority health disparities research. If funded, this would bolster CSDA&#39;s chances to be a host site for the NIH R25 proposal and will help CSDA in applying for an NSF grant for Research Experiences for Undergraduates (NSF 19-582).\n<br></div>","topAchievements4":"<div>CSDA launched a very successful colloquium series this year.

Established in 1993, we pursue new ways to use technology to address practical problems of information management and service delivery in government. CTG UAlbany has collaborated with hundreds of domestic and international researchers on understanding and applying emerging technologies. At the same time, CTG UAlbany has worked with scores of local, state, federal, and international government bodies as a trusted advisor and facilitator of management and policy decisions to govern the use of new technologies as tools for public service transformation.</div>","vision":"<div>Work with governments worldwide transforming public services through innovations in technology, policy and management.</div>","annualBudget":"Despite the many challenges resulting from the COVID19 global pandemic, CTG continued to thrive while pursuing its rich and diverse research and project-related activities, working to collaborate with and transform local, state, national, and international governments and communities. As a result of the fiscal challenges created by the pandemic, the University implemented various restrictions, including a budget reduction, spending directives, and a hiring freeze, all which directly impacted CTG. Other challenges for CTG included the disruption of a move from off-campus to a smaller on-campus location which significantly reduced our operational costs, while allowing the university to benefit from an increase in overhead revenue. Three key staff turnovers took place throughout the year and resulted in the loss of 1 FTE in the Research Division. This occurred when our Research Director moved into the Center Director role with no replacement of FTE. CTG adapted to all of these new conditions and continued to work seamlessly and effectively while operating in a remote work environment. Furthermore, it brought in new funding throughout the year which helped to continue its mission and helped support graduates students and staff no longer fully funded though the state due to budget reductions. It also helped to support CTG’s operational expenses.\nCTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG realized $271,645 in IFR revenue from five RF projects and $966,875 from five state-site MOUs and contract. Combined, overall revenue for CTG FY 2020-2021 was $1,238,520 which helped to support annual operating expenses of $527,447 per year. \nThe expense categories included facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, and utilities for nine months), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online conferences, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,700. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. \nCTG’s PSR state allocation of $922,532 supported 9 FTEs at the start, but with two retirements and one promotion to an external department, support was reduced by 1.6 FTEs to 7.4 FTEs. One FTE was lost and the remaining payroll of .6 FTE is now supported through a CTG IFR account. The remaining current state allocation is $818,022. \nTotal budget reductions this year included $58,093 (line 04496) and $37,560 (line 14824), totaling $95,653 returned to the state. PSR line 04496 (Krumm-Schwan) changed from $119,113 to $61,020 used to fund a portion combined with funding from 900309 of $13,980 to meet the  $75,000  salary for the promotion of Susan Gushlaw into Director of Finance and Administration. The balance of PSR on line 04496 of $58,093 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. PSR line 14824 (Costello) will change from $90,580 to $65,000. PSR will support $53,020 of the salary for positon of Lead Programmer with combined funding from 900309 of $11,980. The balance of PSR online 14824 of $37,560 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. CTG plans to utilize IFR funds to hire a Research Post Doc and a Business Analyst to cover lost positions in this and the last FY.\nCTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $778,005 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures award for $310,645 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation award for $30,824. Total new state awards equaled $341,469. New awards through the Research Foundation included The Political Economy of interoperability funded through the Inter-American Development Bank for $40,951. Also, work began on the Social Determinants of Health: Differential Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York State COVID19 MHD award amounting to $354,634. This was allocated through authorization of the NYS Governor’s Office. Total New RF awards equaled $395,585. \nIn addition, CTG has two proposals and one contract pending including the Public Libraries as Catalysts in Local and Regional Innovation Ecosystems submitted to the Institute of Museum and Library Science for $451,901.

There continues to be a federal, state, and industry focus on the area of smart cities/communities and investment of information and communication technologies (e.g. machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics) at the local government to help improve government operations and provide public services. Given our expertise and research interest in the policy, management, and technology dimensions of information and technology use by governments at all levels, CTG UAlbany can continue to make significant contributions in this area for next 1-5 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<br>\n<br>We continue to see working with state agencies in New York and beyond as another big opportunity to advance our research. As state governments and individual state agencies try to modernize older and legacy information systems and adopt new data management and analysis techniques there is a lot of opportunity to apply CTG UAlbany&#39;s existing expertise and conduct new externally funded research in this area.\n<br>\n<br>We are actively pursuing research project partnerships with faculty and professional researchers at CEHC and ASRC. We see a lot of opportunity to collaborate on policy, technology, and management issues in the emergency preparedness, homeland and cyber security, and weather domains and produce competitive and innovative research proposals. \n<br></div>","bigChallenges":"<div>Due to professionals staff leaving and difficulty in rehiring due to recent budget constraints, CTG UAlbany has seen a significant decrease in non faculty professional researchers who help manage and provide support to our research and other projects. This is impacting the number and size of projects we can conduct simultaneously. However, we appreciate the VPR&#39;s, Budget, and HR&#39;s recent support for us to replace our two vacant positions due to retirement. In addition we appreciate their support for us to hire temp service staff with available external funding to support research and other projects. </div>","resourceNeeds":"<div>CTG UAlbany, with the assitance of UAlbany, successfully moved to on campus space by the end of March 2021. This move will allow us to be closer to our students, fellow faculty researchers, and campus administration.

As a result of the fiscal challenges created by the pandemic, the University implemented various restrictions, including a budget reduction, spending directives, and a hiring freeze, all which directly impacted CTG. Other challenges for CTG included the disruption of a move from off-campus to a smaller on-campus location which significantly reduced our operational costs, while allowing the university to benefit from an increase in overhead revenue. Three key staff turnovers took place throughout the year and resulted in the loss of 1 FTE in the Research Division. This occurred when our Research Director moved into the Center Director role with no replacement of FTE. CTG adapted to all of these new conditions and continued to work seamlessly and effectively while operating in a remote work environment. Furthermore, it brought in new funding throughout the year which helped to continue its mission and helped support graduates students and staff no longer fully funded though the state due to budget reductions. It also helped to support CTG’s operational expenses.\n<br>CTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG realized $271,645 in IFR revenue from five RF projects and $966,875 from five state-site MOUs and contract. Combined, overall revenue for CTG FY 2020-2021 was $1,238,520 which helped to support annual operating expenses of $527,447 per year. \n<br>The expense categories included facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, and utilities for nine months), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online conferences, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,700. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. \n<br>CTG’s PSR state allocation of $922,532 supported 9 FTEs at the start, but with two retirements and one promotion to an external department, support was reduced by 1.6 FTEs to 7.4 FTEs. One FTE was lost and the remaining payroll of .6 FTE is now supported through a CTG IFR account. The remaining current state allocation is $818,022. \n<br>Total budget reductions this year included $58,093 (line 04496) and $37,560 (line 14824), totaling $95,653 returned to the state. PSR line 04496 (Krumm-Schwan) changed from $119,113 to $61,020 used to fund a portion combined with funding from 900309 of $13,980 to meet the&nbsp; $75,000&nbsp; salary for the promotion of Susan Gushlaw into Director of Finance and Administration. The balance of PSR on line 04496 of $58,093 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. PSR line 14824 (Costello) will change from $90,580 to $65,000. PSR will support $53,020 of the salary for positon of Lead Programmer with combined funding from 900309 of $11,980. The balance of PSR online 14824 of $37,560 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. CTG plans to utilize IFR funds to hire a Research Post Doc and a Business Analyst to cover lost positions in this and the last FY.\n<br>CTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $778,005 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures award for $310,645 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation award for $30,824. Total new state awards equaled $341,469. New awards through the Research Foundation included The Political Economy of interoperability funded through the Inter-American Development Bank for $40,951. Also, work began on the Social Determinants of Health: Differential Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York State COVID19 MHD award amounting to $354,634. This was allocated through authorization of the NYS Governor’s Office. Total New RF awards equaled $395,585. \n<br>In addition, CTG has two proposals and one contract pending including the Public Libraries as Catalysts in Local and Regional Innovation Ecosystems submitted to the Institute of Museum and Library Science for $451,901. Also submitted was a proposal to FEMA, in coordination with CEHC, for $1,007,198 (CTG Portion). CTG is also awaiting confirmation of funding through the City of Schenectady for the Enabling the Statewide Rollout of the Shared Information Resource award for $189,462.Total potential revenue for the coming fiscal year totals $1,648,561.\n<br>Residual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support a Post Doc to help fill the gap left by the loss of the FTE in the Research Division, as well provide funding for a Business Analyst to make up for the loss of an FTE in a similar position in FY 2019-2020.

Over the past five years, ASRC’s payroll expenditures totaled $10,706,372 – an average of $2,141,274 per year. One full-time research facilitator and one part-time IT support person are supported by the VPR.\nPost-docs, research scientists, visiting scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students are primarily paid from research grants; some are supported from start-up funds provided to SUNY2020 faculty. Most ASRC faculty are on 9-month academic year appointments and are paid summer salary from research grants or start-up funds.\nOTPS:\nASRC’s operations, including operations at the UAlbany location and at Whiteface Mountain, are covered by IFR revenue recovered from sponsored programs. Over the past five years, ASRC’s OTPS expenditures at the Albany location have totaled $202,696, an average of $40,539 per year. Not counting annual telephone charges of almost $19,000 per year, OTPS expenses at ASRC average about $21,539 per year. The Whiteface location’s OTPS expenditures over five years total $77,606, an average of $15,521 per year.\nOne faculty member had a legacy IFR account that covered some OTPS expenses such as Verizon Wireless.\nStrategic Investment:\nIn the past, ASRC has received overhead recovery from the VPR to be used to grow research activity at ASRC. We have about $70,900 remaining in cash to spend on the state-side. On the RF side there is a legacy overhead recovery account primarily used in support of our RF p-card program as the initial source to pay the Bank of America bill monthly; expenses are then moved to the appropriate sponsored award through a reconciliation process.\nEvents:\nASRC has both UAlbany Foundation funds in the Ray Falconer Endowment and UAS (Auxiliary Services) funds to support lectures and colloquies.\n","stateHeadcount":"22","rfHeadcount":"68","stateNumber":"20.68","rfNumber":"51.65","additionalAmount1":"0","additionalSource1":"","additionalAmount2":"0","additionalSource2":"","additionalAmount3":"0","additionalSource3":"","federalApplicationsGoal":"24","privateApplicationsGoal":"10","stateApplicationsGoal":"6","federalApplicationsActual":"24.2","privateApplicationsActual":"5","stateApplicationsActual":"1","federalAwardsGoal":"20","privateAwardsGoal":"6","stateAwardsGoal":"7","federalAwardsActual":"10","privateAwardsActual":"2","stateAwardsActual":"4","lsProposalsGoal":"2","lsProposalsActual":"2","lsAwardsGoal":"0","lsAwardsActual":"1","sttrProposalsGoal":"1","sttrProposalsActual":"0","sttrAwardssGoal":"0","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"0","booksAuthoredActual":"0","bookChaptersGoal":"0","bookChaptersActual":"0","publicationsGoal":"40","publicationsActual":"73","listOfPublications":"<div>1.\t8/2020: *Osei, M., L.

The LSRB also has an imaging core. There is a strong possibility of funds available for purchase of a Nextseq 2000 sequencer. If the CFG could be moved to the LSRB, co-location can enable us to venture in to new areas such as Spatial transcriptomics which combines single cell, imaging and NGS as is gaining fast popularity.

Our instrumentation is aging and needs upgrading/replacement\n<br>2. Our current operational models are in need of revision: (a) CFG needs to be added to grant funding proposals we support more regularly. (b) Currently it takes a lot of time and effort to track payments between RF, State to reconcile with our own records that are more up to date. (c)Deficit funding does not allow us to forecast our future budgets effectively.\n<br>3. There is no marketing or advisory support for our services.

We started out 2020 with plans for upgrades to the observatory including structural repairs as well as electrical upgrades and a roof replacement project. These plans were to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the observatory and also to predicate deployment of several new instruments by Dr. Sara Lance. Several meetings were held with Facilities Management staff as well as the design team from CSARCH. The work was put out to bid in April 2020. Only one bid was received and was determined to be too high. Due to financial constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic it was decided that the scope of the project should be reduced and put back out to bid. We decided to focus on the most urgent need which is the roof replacement. However even with the reduced scope of work we were informed that there were not funds available to move forward this year. The current plan is to have staff from the UALBANY roofing shop come up on Wednesday 9/16/2020 to attempt to refasten the existing roof to get us through the winter.

Each of these systems is comprised of a collection of both mechanical and electronic components, each with its own maintenance needs and operational service life. \n<br>\n<br>In order for any manufacturing or experimental system to function efficiently and extend the operational service life, each component within that system requires a well thought out, and carefully adhered to maintenance schedule. However, not adhering to the maintenance regime can, and often does lead to the premature failure of components resulting in the need for expensive repair or replacement. Unexpected component failures lead to unscheduled down time leading to the expenditure of time and capital that could otherwise be utilized to extend the capabilities of the system. \n<br>\n<br>The IBL has traditionally functioned with a contingent of personnel that ensured that the systems comprising the IBL had the care and scrutiny described above. The team consisted two to three technicians and engineers to maintain the systems and implement any upgrades or refits.&nbsp; This staffing level was maintained for the forty plus years that the IBL had been in existence. \n<br>\n<br>The current contingent consists of one technician and a part-time project manager. This staffing level is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the IBL and its continued operation, let alone expand and grow. As a result of the staffing shortfall, routine maintenance has been deferred resulting in unscheduled down time and avoidable expense. As a consequence, the time devoted to the unscheduled repairs further diminishes the time available for routine maintenance which leads to addition unscheduled downs. This spiraling degradation of the IBL’s capabilities over a decade of neglect has reached a near unsustainable level and needs to be addressed before the trend becomes unrecoverable. It goes without saying that if the day to day maintenance of the IBL systems are suffering, then the development and implementation of a Strategic Plan is impossible.\n<br> \n<br>The current situation has already adversely affected research being performed at UAlbany as well as other Academic and Industrial affiliates. To continue on this path would eventually lead to a situation where the IBL would not be able to fulfill its Mission. \n<br>\n<br></div>","resourceNeeds":"<div>The IBL requires at least one more additional full time Technician to help maintain the systems at the IBL. It would also benefit from a capital investment by the university to upgrade and modernize some of the aging components that are prone to failure. This would also lower our energy consumption which would be inline with the universities overall energy goals.</div>","strategicSuggestions":"<div>Have a modernized and efficient, fully staffed facility.</div>","otherthoughts":"<div>The IBL is a unique facility that has capabilities that are not available anywhere else in the world. Although it lies under ground and mostly unknown by the wider University population, its past impact on the development of our modern understanding of material science is profound. Moving forward, its expanded capabilities and practices should allow it to continue to contribute to our collective understanding of the universe in a very meaningful way. This of course is dependent on whether or not the IBL has the resources needed to first maintain, and then advance its capabilities.&nbsp; </div>","partners":[{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Ion Beam

Established in 1993, we pursue new ways to use technology to address practical problems of information management and service delivery in government. CTG UAlbany has collaborated with hundreds of domestic and international researchers on understanding and applying emerging technologies. At the same time, CTG UAlbany has worked with scores of local, state, federal, and international government bodies as a trusted advisor and facilitator of management and policy decisions to govern the use of new technologies as tools for public service transformation.</div>","vision":"<div>Work with governments worldwide transforming public services through innovations in technology, policy and management.</div>","annualBudget":"CTG UAlbany’s financial stability over its 26 years in service as an applied research Institute, has been based on its tenured and experienced faculty, researchers, professional administration and finance and project staff. CTG’s subject matter expertise has an ability to continue to build capacity and capability through its projects and research, while generating the necessary project revenues to support CTG’s operational expenses of over $550K annually.  These annually generated revenues allow CTG to support several project support positions, external UAlbany research faculty, graduate students and its programs or work through MOUs, revenue contracts and research agreements with partners both through the Research Foundation such as federal agencies, corporate sponsors, and international governments or through the University at Albany with state agencies, municipal and local governments, state authorities, and not for profits.   CTG’s FY 2019 PSR state allocation of $971,049  supported 12 FTE’s, during this  fiscal year CTG lost 2 PSR funded positons, one position to WFP committee review of Communications Manager denied for rehiring at $51,000 and the second position to the 15 % state reduction of Sr. Project Assistant at $49,993, totaling $100,993 in permanent state PSR funding.  CTG’s professional staff funded by the PSR allocation are engaged in CTG’s development of new programs and innovations, projects and research proposals, day to day operations, business development activities, academic and community engagement, and other related outreach and dissemination activities within the University and globally.   In 2019, CTG UAlbany conducted 8 Research Foundation sponsored projects and 3 state agency, local government, and not for profits projects simultaneously.  CTG UAlbany revenue generates annually, through various sources, to support CTG’s IFR operational expenditures which for FY 2019 totaled $510,581. CTG’s revenue generation through its various projects supports its annual operational budget of OTPS which includes the following expense categories of  facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, utilities), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, business travel, staff development, conferences, and any other non-PSR  expense needed to operate CTG UAlbany. CTG doesn’t receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget.  A unique aspect of CTG’s financial/business model relative to most academic departments and other research units; is that CTG not only relies on its traditional research funded projects, but has many state agency projects, under state MOUs and revenue contracts. These state projects are a part of the strategic business development and financial planning that is the necessary support our annual operational budget. Within this template provided, it doesn’t allow a place for CTG UAlbany to report those state MOUs and Revenue contracts pending, as is the case for pending submitted RF proposals. Therefore, the information is provided here in the narrative.  CTG has several MOUs pending with state agencies such as: 1. NYS BOE’s Future elections at $310,000, 2. NYS BOE Election Remediation Risk at $35,000, along with several other opportunities in the business development, additional work on the project with the United Arab Emirates estimated at an additional $40K and new work with the United Nations for a round two which is in the business development stages. Also, we are submitting a preliminary proposal to IMLS related focused on exploring the role of public libraries as intermediaries of innovation in local and regional contexts.","stateHeadcount":"15","rfHeadcount":"1","stateNumber":"12.25","rfNumber":"0.25","additionalAmount1":"813839","additionalSource1":"IFR 900309 RF IFR Revenue","additionalAmount2":"191167","additionalSource2":"IFR 910029 Project Revenue","additionalAmount3":"0","additionalSource3":"","federalApplicationsGoal":"2","privateApplicationsGoal":"3","stateApplicationsGoal":"1","federalApplicationsActual":"4","privateApplicationsActual":"5","stateApplicationsActual":"5","federalAwardsGoal":"1","privateAwardsGoal":"2","stateAwardsGoal":"1","federalAwardsActual":"0","privateAwardsActual":"3","stateAwardsActual":"5","lsProposalsGoal":"1","lsProposalsActual":"1","lsAwardsGoal":"1","lsAwardsActual":"0","sttrProposalsGoal":"0","sttrProposalsActual":"0","sttrAwardssGoal":"0","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"1","booksAuthoredActual":"2","bookChaptersGoal":"4","bookChaptersActual":"2","publicationsGoal":"10","publicationsActual":"27","listOfPublications":"<div>1.\tDemircioglu, M.

There continues to be a federal, state, and industry focus on the area of smart cities/communities and investment of information and communication technologies (e.g. machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics) at the local government to help improve government operations and provide public services. Given our expertise and research interest in the policy, management, and technology dimensions of information and technology use by governments at all levels, CTG UAlbany can continue to make significant contributions in this area for next 1-5 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<br>We continue to see working with state agencies in New York and beyond as another big opportunity to advance our research. As state governments and individual state agencies try to modernize older and legacy information systems and adopt new data management and analysis techniques there is a lot of opportunity to apply CTG UAlbany&#39;s existing expertise and conduct new externally funded research in this area.\n<br>We are actively pursuing research project partnerships with faculty and professional researchers at CEHC and ASRC. We see a lot of opportunity to collaborate on policy, technology, and management issues in the emergency preparedness, homeland and cyber security, and weather domains and produce competitive and innovative research proposals. \n<br></div>","bigChallenges":"<div>Due to professionals staff leaving and difficulty in rehiring due to current budget constraints, CTG UAlbany has seen a significant decrease in non faculty professional researchers who help manage and provide support to our research and other projects. This is impacting the number and size of projects we can conduct simultaneously. \n<br></div>","resourceNeeds":"<div>CTG UAlbany is actively seeking space on campus that will allow ups to be closer to our students, fellow faculty researchers, and campus administration. In addition, space on campus will allow CTG to dedicate more of its external reseach funding dollars to support paid undergradute and graduate interns and assistantships \n<br></div>","strategicSuggestions":"<div>Continue to invest in support for proposal development and pre and post award support in general. Also, we think that it is very important to expand the staff and expertise of the UAlbany technology development office. Resources and expertise in this area are critical to helping CTG UAlbany and other researchers at UAlbany determine if and how their research findings can be protected and commercialized. \n<br></div>","otherthoughts":"<div>NA</div>","partners":[{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Tony Civitella","JobTitle":"Global Advisory Board Member","Department":"","School":"","Organization":"Transfinder ","Email":"acivitella@transfinder.com"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":" Jim Dias","JobTitle":"Global Advisory Board Member","Department":"Division for Research","School":"","Organization":"","Email":"jdias@albany.edu"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Kate Garman","JobTitle":"Global Advisory Board Member","Department":"","School":"","Organization":"CityFi","Email":"kate@cityfi.co"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Markku Raitio","JobTitle":"Global Advisory Board Member","Department":"","School":"","Organization":"Former CIO City of Helsinki","Email":"markku.raitio@gmail.com"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Steve Spano","JobTitle":"Global Advisory Board Member","Department":"","School":"","Organization":"Tableau","Email":"sspano@tableau.com"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Jenn Gustetic","JobTitle":"Global Advisory Board Member","Department":"","School":"","Organization":"NASA - Small Business Administration","Email":"jenn.gustetic@gmail.com"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Bob Chen","JobTitle":"Global Advisory Board Member","Department":"","School":"","Organization":"Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)- Columbia ","Email":"bchen@ciesin.columbia.edu"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Mark Headd","JobTitle":"Global Advisory Board Member","Department":"","School":"","Organization":"US General Services Administration","Email":"mheadd@gmail.com"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Greg Potter","JobTitle":"Global Advisory Board Member","Department":"","School":"","Organization":"Tompkins County","Email":"gpotter@tompkins-co.org"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Sharon Dawes","JobTitle":"Fellow Emerita","Department":"Formerly CTG","School":"","Organization":"","Email":"sdawes@albany.edu"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Yumei Chen","JobTitle":"Research Fellow","Department":"","School":"","Organization":"Jinan University","Email":"tchenym@jnu.edu.cn"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Felippe Cronemberger","JobTitle":"Research Fellow","Department":"","School":"","Organization":"ITMO University","Email":"fcronemberger@albany.edu"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Ahmet Güler","JobTitle":"Research Fellow","Department":"Criminal Justice Policy and Administration","School":"","Organization":"Pennsylvania State University","Email":"ahmetguler16@yahoo.com"},{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Technology in Government","FullName":"Norman J.

Established in 1993, we pursue new ways to use technology to address practical problems of information management and service delivery in government. CTG UAlbany has collaborated with hundreds of domestic and international researchers on understanding and applying emerging technologies. At the same time, CTG UAlbany has worked with scores of local, state, federal, and international government bodies as a trusted advisor and facilitator of management and policy decisions to govern the use of new technologies as tools for public service transformation.</div>","vision":"<div>Work with governments worldwide transforming public services through innovations in technology, policy and management.</div>","annualBudget":"<div>CTG UAlbany’s financial stability over its 26 years in service as an applied research Institute, has been based on its tenured and experienced faculty, researchers, professional administration and finance and project staff. CTG’s subject matter expertise has an ability to continue to build capacity and capability through its projects and research, while generating the necessary project revenues to support CTG’s operational expenses of over $550K annually.&nbsp; These annually generated revenues allow CTG to support several project support positions, external UAlbany research faculty, graduate students and its programs or work through MOUs, revenue contracts and research agreements with partners both through the Research Foundation such as federal agencies, corporate sponsors, and international governments or through the University at Albany with state agencies, municipal and local governments, state authorities, and not for profits.&nbsp;&nbsp; CTG’s FY 2019 PSR state allocation of $971,049&nbsp; supported 12 FTE’s, during this&nbsp; fiscal year CTG lost 2 PSR funded positons, one position to WFP committee review of Communications Manager denied for rehiring at $51,000 and the second position to the 15 % state reduction of Sr. Project Assistant at $49,993, totaling $100,993 in permanent state PSR funding.&nbsp; CTG’s professional staff funded by the PSR allocation are engaged in CTG’s development of new programs and innovations, projects and research proposals, day to day operations, business development activities, academic and community engagement, and other related outreach and dissemination activities within the University and globally.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2019, CTG UAlbany conducted 8 Research Foundation sponsored projects and 3 state agency, local government, and not for profits projects simultaneously.&nbsp; CTG UAlbany revenue generates annually, through various sources, to support CTG’s IFR operational expenditures which for FY 2019 totaled $510,581. CTG’s revenue generation through its various projects supports its annual operational budget of OTPS which includes the following expense categories of&nbsp; facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, utilities), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, business travel, staff development, conferences, and any other non-PSR&nbsp; expense needed to operate CTG UAlbany. CTG doesn’t receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget.&nbsp; A unique aspect of CTG’s financial/business model relative to most academic departments and other research units; is that CTG not only relies on its traditional research funded projects, but has many state agency projects, under state MOUs and revenue contracts. These state projects are a part of the strategic business development and financial planning that is the necessary support our annual operational budget. Within this template provided, it doesn’t allow a place for CTG UAlbany to report those state MOUs and Revenue contracts pending, as is the case for pending submitted RF proposals. Therefore, the information is provided here in the narrative.&nbsp; CTG has several MOUs pending with state agencies such as: 1. NYS BOE’s Future elections at $310,000, 2. NYS BOE Election Remediation Risk at $35,000, along with several other opportunities in the business development, additional work on the project with the United Arab Emirates estimated at an additional $40K and new work with the United Nations for a round two which is in the business development stages.

Since 2018, we had no official director. The COVID-19 pandemic put things on hold, but we have re-organized our leadership team and have set goals to fulfill this upcoming year.</div>","topAchievements2":"<div>We have begun work on building an infrastructure to include undergraduate students of color in population-science research with our Research Associates.</div>","topAchievements3":"","topAchievements4":"","topAchievements5":"","goal1":"<div>Our first priority is to increase our funding portfolio, with an emphasis on applying for grants in the Population Dynamics Branch (PDB) of NICHD\n<br>\n<br>Expanding funding in the latter agency will increase our ability to be successful in being funded by a future center grant from NICHD. This priority fits directly with the Strategic Plan’s goal, in the Research Excellence area, of increasing the ratio of faculty with research grants. To achieve this goal, we plan to invite a program officer from NICHD to discuss the funding priorities with our associates as well as others on campus. In addition, we will organize a meeting with our faculty associates from the School of Education, Sociology, the School of Public Health, and researchers at the New York State Department of Health to provide information to CSDA associates, graduate students, and the university community about datasets (restricted and non-restricted – like Upstate Kids, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, and NY State data) that could lead to funding opportunities for researchers in CSDA as well as across the university. We will measure our success by gauging the increase in applications for funding to NICHD and other funding agencies. </div>","goal2":"<div>Our second main priority is to forge linkages with other units on campus that do not know about CSDA but could potentially benefit from alignments with population-based researchers and from whom CSDA associates could benefit.\n<br>\n<br>None of our CSDA associates are currently from the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security, and Cybersecurity (CEHC) or from the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. However, the research that is conducted in both units is focused on disasters and climate change, which has implications for the migration and the health and well-being of populations, two of the main foci of CSDA. Forging collaborations across programs is one of the main priorities of the Strategic Plan in the area of Research Excellence. To achieve this goal, we plan to hold a meeting with key researchers in CEHC and the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences and have short flash presentations so that all parties involved will get to know about each other’s current research interests. We will measure our success by gauging future collaborations sparked by this meeting and potentially others in the future. \n<br>\n<br></div>","goal3":"<div>Our third priority is to explore ways to attract students, particularly underrepresented minorities, to engage in population-based research, enhance student experiences of those already engaged in population-based research, and ultimately, through the former endeavors, grow a workforce to assist CSDA associates and others in the local community and government with their research. \n<br>\n<br>To achieve this goal, we will target funding opportunities from the National Science Foundation (NSF) INCLUDES Planning Grants (https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505679) due on July 13, 2020 as well as NSF’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) due on August 26, 2020. With respect to the NSF INCLUDES program, Deedee Bennett from CEHC has acquired funding through this mechanism, and we will draw on her expertise in achieving this goal, which will also work well in fulfilling our goals to achieve priority 2 (described above). We will target StAR based funding to get short-term assistance in laying the groundwork for these proposals. The basis of these proposals will be to leverage our multidisciplinary research capacity to create a hub that will connect students to research opportunities at UAlbany, local and state governments, and private industry. CSDA will provide research training, networking, and professionalization opportunities in the area of population-based science as it relates to the data revolution that links the disciplines together. CSDA would position itself to become UAlbany’s core for statistical consulting and training across units and seek to generate funds from others seeking these services. Our initial success will be based upon our ability to acquire funding from NSF. </div>","goal4":"<div>One of our other priorities is to maintain connections with other population-based research centers in New York State and elsewhere. CSDA and the School of Public Health at Albany have partnered with Cornell and Syracuse Universities in participating annually in an Upstate Population conference. We will continue to engage in this endeavor because it facilitates connections with neighboring research universities and promotes collaborations that can lead to extramural funding. CSDA will also continue to be a member of the Association of Population Centers (APC) and participate in APC annual meetings. Currently, there is an initiative among centers in APC to work with each other on an NIH-sponsored training grant. CSDA is engaged in this endeavor. Samantha Friedman will be the Primary Leader on this initiative and will represent CSDA at the APC meeting as well as the Upstate Population conference.</div>","goal5":"Another priority is for CSDA to engage in its own Strategic Planning during the next year and develop its vision for the next five years so that its mission and goals are clearer, and inclusive of all associates, and aligned with the vision of the University. To this end, we will hold Executive Committee meetings to plan a retreat that we will hold within the next year (by November 2020), and within six months after the retreat, we will finalize a strategic plan document with our vision. Samantha Friedman will be the Primary Leader on this initiative. ","actions1":"<div>To achieve this goal, we will:\n<br>1) have a colloquium series this year to showcase successful NICHD grantees from other universities and their research;\n<br>\n<br>2)&nbsp; organize meetings around each of our core themes -- 1) population health; 2) immigration and internal migration; and 3) spatial inequalities -- with our faculty associates working in those areas to identify opportunities for future collaboration as it fits with the Population Dynamics Branch of PDB.</div>","actions2":"<div>To achieve this goal, we plan to hold a meeting with key researchers in CEHC and the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences and have short flash presentations so that all parties involved will get to know about each other’s current research interests. Relatedly, we want to build a data infrastructure by amassing data on climate and disasters to facilitate the research of our associates.</div>","actions3":"<div>To achieve this goal, we will: 1) identify our associates who are working on research with undergraduates; 2) make CSDA activities more visible to undergraduates at UAlbany by encouraging their participation in our colloquium series and by holding virtual events surrounding Census 2020; 3) network with other departments who do not know about CSDA but whose students could be of great value to CSDA associates (e.g., data science, statistics, and information science); and 4) form a small group of CSDA associates that will collaborate to write a proposal for the National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates due in August 2021.</div>","actions4":"","actions5":"","metrics1":"We will measure our success by gauging the increase in applications for funding to NICHD and other funding agencies.","metrics2":"We will measure our success by gauging future collaborations sparked by this meeting and potentially others in the future.","metrics3":"<div>Our success will be based upon our ability to attract undergraduate students to participate in our events; to involve more undergraduate and graduate students of color in the research of CSDA associates; and to apply for funding via the NSF REU mechanism.</div>","metrics4":"","metrics5":"","timeframe1":"June 2021June 2021","timeframe2":"June 2021","timeframe3":"<div>June 2021June 2021</div>","timeframe4":"","timeframe5":"","actionsImplemented1":"<div>We have encouraged our associates to apply for NICHD grants through the Population Dynamics Branch.&nbsp; We also have renewed our application to maintain our access in our coldroom lab to the restricted data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health.

Dr. Fussell has received funds from PDB at NICHD.\n<br>\n<br>We would like to build the capacity of our Research Associates to easily access climate-based data to engage in demographic research. We have reached out twice to colleagues in CEHC with no response. We will reach out to Chris Thorncroft to get his input.&nbsp; </div>","changes3":"<div>We are continuing to work towards the goal of applying for an NSF REU next year.&nbsp; We are gathering information on all of our associates who are working on research with undergraduates, and we will hold meetings with associates who are interested in working on this NSF REU initiatve.</div>","changes4":"","changes5":"<div>Last year&#39;s Executive Committee was too large and proved ineffective to make regular decisions about CSDA.&nbsp; Over the summer we split the committee.&nbsp; We now have seven people on the Executive Committee, and the other members will serve on the Advisory Board.&nbsp; The Executive Committee is meeting monthly to establish this year&#39;s goals for CSDA.</div>","noofpartners":"","otherThoughtsToGrowResearch":"<div>Grow the data support staff at the university. We have Master&#39;s degrees in Biostatistics, Data Analytics, Econometrics, and Information Science, among other fields. Yet, we have no infrastructure for researchers to get assistance with their data analyses and statistics. CSDA plans to capitalize on this gap since the university has done nothing in this area. CHSR cannot fill this gap. They are understaffed and do not have the talent in statistical analyses necessary to tackle more difficult research questions.</div>","bigChallenges":"<div>Lack of a research infrastructure in data analytics. If researchers have to obtain data, clean data, run analyses, there&#39;s little time left to write grants and publish papers. We need mid- level people to do the former tasks and leave the big ideas and science generation for the faculty.\n<br></div>","resourceNeeds":"<div>We would value getting an administrative assistant for my unit and/or a graduate assistant line.</div>","strategicSuggestions":"<div>We want to get more information about how to access climate/disaster related data.&nbsp; This would ease our associates&#39; abilities to pursue research on demographic events -- migration and mortality -- and relate them to climate change.&nbsp; We would greatly appreciate the VPR&#39;s assistance in helping us forge linkages with other units on campus.&nbsp; I&#39;ve reached out to CEHC twice and got no response.&nbsp; If this comes from the VPR, other units might be more receptive.</div>","otherthoughts":"<div>It would be useful to hold a Coffee Hour and have researchers from across campus talk about climate/disaster sources of data.&nbsp; There are units on campus working on this, but having a coordinated effort for researchers to learn about these sources would be of tremendous value.</div>","partners":[{"year":"FY 19-20","unit":"Center for Social &

Over the past five years, ASRC’s payroll expenditures totaled $10,706,372 – an average of $2,141,274 per year. One full-time research facilitator and one part-time IT support person are supported by the VPR. Post-docs, research scientists, visiting scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students are primarily paid from research grants; some are supported from start-up funds provided to SUNY2020 faculty. Most ASRC faculty are on 9-month academic year appointments and are paid summer salary from research grants or start-up funds. OTPS: ASRC’s operations, including operations at the UAlbany location and at Whiteface Mountain, are covered by IFR revenue recovered from sponsored programs. Over the past five years, ASRC’s OTPS expenditures at the Albany location have totaled $202,696, an average of $40,539 per year. Not counting annual telephone charges of almost $19,000 per year, OTPS expenses at ASRC average about $21,539 per year. The Whiteface location’s OTPS expenditures over five years total $77,606, an average of $15,521 per year. One faculty member had a legacy IFR account that covered some OTPS expenses such as Verizon Wireless. Strategic Investment: In the past, ASRC has received overhead recovery from the VPR to be used to grow research activity at ASRC. We have about $70,900 remaining in cash to spend on the state-side. On the RF side there is a legacy overhead recovery account primarily used in support of our RF p-card program as the initial source to pay the Bank of America bill monthly; expenses are then moved to the appropriate sponsored award through a reconciliation process.

Home to a 2016 NIMHD S21 Health Disparities Endowment Grant, a 2009 NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center of Excellence, and a 2004 NIMHD R24 EXPORT Center, CEMHD works toward eliminating health disparities by developing capacity in faculty at the University at Albany and partnering with community groups to identify their health concerns and the sources of disparities, and then plans, implements and tests strategies to alleviate them. CEMHD is a partnership among community groups, hospitals, state and county health departments, the State of New York and the University at Albany. CEMHD&#39;s focus on minorities and under-served populations in the smaller cities and towns of Upstate New York is premised upon the notion that health disparities found in these areas differ from those in the larger cities, and that the appropriate solutions will also differ. Since most of the research on minority health disparities, and the programs that have resulted from it, has focused on populations in large cities, relatively little is known about the distinct causes of poorer health among minorities in smaller cities.

The keynote speech by Dr. Camara Phyllis Jones, a national expert on equity and health issues, “Achieving Health Equity: Naming Racism and Moving to Action” focused on the social and behavioral factors influencing racial differences on health outcomes and quality of life for African Americans. There were 231 registrations and 131 attendees, including Community partners, government officials, researchers, faculty, professional staff, postdoctoral associates, and students. This year’s Forum included, in addition to the keynote speaker and reaction panel, 3 concurrent panels, organized around the topics of Environmental Health Disparities, Maternal Health Disparities, and Health Communication, Digital Divide, and Messaging. Each panel featured 3 faculty researchers, as well as a community based practitioner.\n<br></div>","topAchievements4":"<div>Strengthening community outreach, information dissemination, public engagement, and action related to health disparities research. \n<br>\n<br>a. The CEMHD supports two local community task forces in Albany and Amsterdam, NY dedicated to community-researcher partnerships to address health disparities. Regular members include community leaders from these areas, mostly affiliated with governmental and non-governmental organizations dedicated to health and human services, and researchers from the University at Albany. Members of these task forces work together to identify causes and possible solutions for health disparities in the area, develop research projects to document these health disparities, and provide guidance and feedback on research projects in these communities. Both convene approximately once a month. The Albany Minority Health Task Force is mostly focused on the needs of African Americans and the poor in the city of Albany. The Amsterdam Minority Health Task Force focuses on the needs of migrants, non-English speakers (particularly Spanish speakers), mothers, and the elderly in the more rural region of Montgomery and Fulton counties of New York. \n<br>b. In 2020-2021, the Albany Minority Health Task Force, in collaboration with faculty from UAlbany and support from the University at Albany COVID-19 and MHD in NYS Engaged Researchers (ER) Group, designed and executed a survey to document the local impact of COVID-19 on communities of color. The report can be found in an open-access repository through the UAlbany Library’s Scholar’s Archive. In June 2021, CEMHD researchers presented survey results at the 2021 Summer Symposium - Differential Impacts of COVID-19 in NYS.\n<br>c. HDTFs participate in the community health task forces to develop the Fellows’ organizational and operational skills and qualifications as community engaged health disparities researcher, thus aiding in the acquisition of a professional position. Almost every Task Force meeting in 2021-2022 was attended by at least one Fellow. CEMHD continues to work on increasing outreach and communication to local and larger communities through our web presence within the UAlbany Website and through social media outlets. The website hosts both publications in health disparities for our Fellows and Associates, and any upcoming events that our HDTFs and Associates are involved in. Our quarterly CEMHD Newsletter/Bulletin is emailed to stakeholders and also available on our website. The Newsletter/Bulletin showcases achievements by Associates and Fellows, and highlights accomplishments of our Amsterdam and Albany Minority Health Task Forces.

for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities (CEMHD) is to contribute to the elimination of minority health disparities in the smaller cities and towns of New York State. CEMHD’s activities focus on three major interrelated areas, in the service of contributing to the elimination of minority health disparities: community engagement, fostering health disparities research, and supporting the development of new health disparities scholars.</div>","vision":"<div>The Center for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities (CEMHD), is a collaborative effort focusing on minority health disparities in the smaller cities and towns of New York. Home to a 2016 NIMHD S21 Health Disparities Endowment Grant, a 2009 NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center of Excellence, and a 2004 NIMHD R24 EXPORT Center, CEMHD works toward eliminating health disparities by developing capacity in faculty at the University at Albany and partnering with community groups to identify their health concerns and the sources of disparities, and then plans, implements and tests strategies to alleviate them. CEMHD is a partnership among community groups, hospitals, state and county health departments, the State of New York and the University at Albany. CEMHD&#39;s focus on minorities and under-served populations in the smaller cities and towns of Upstate New York is premised upon the notion that health disparities found in these areas differ from those in the larger cities, and that the appropriate solutions will also differ. Since most of the research on minority health disparities, and the programs that have resulted from it, has focused on populations in large cities, relatively little is known about the distinct causes of poorer health among minorities in smaller cities. Therefore, another reason for our geographical emphasis is to fill in a gap in the research and to initiate and test the appropriate solutions. </div>","annualBudget":"<div>Projected CEMHD ANNUAL Expenditures\n<br>Projected expenditures from NIH funded S-21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<br>Stipend and fringe for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&nbsp; $143,982.90 \n<br>Tuition and fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&nbsp; $91,966.09\n<br>Travel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&nbsp; $12,000.00 \n<br>Travel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&#39; Primary mentors&nbsp; $12,000.00\n<br>Travel for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&#39; Rotational mentors&nbsp; $3,000.00 \n<br>Writing support for Health Disparities Fellows&nbsp; $7,890.00\n<br>Statistical support for Health Disparities Fellows (grad student)&nbsp; $6,698.64 \n<br>Support for advancing MHD research (grad student)&nbsp; $11,164.40\n<br>Support for collaboration/recruitment platform development (grad student)&nbsp; $24,091.60 \n<br>Logistical support &amp; Task Force liaison (grad student)&nbsp; $25,854.40\n<br>Associate Director of Operations and Research&nbsp;&nbsp; $129,535.81 \n<br>Support for Community Task Force&nbsp;&nbsp; $25,000.00\n<br>Albany Task Force Convener&nbsp;&nbsp; $5,000.00 \n<br>Amsterdam Task Force Convener&nbsp; $8,017.50\n<br>Director&#39;s stipend&nbsp;&nbsp; $39,450.00 \n<br>Director Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 Course releases&nbsp; $20,000.00 \n<br>Endowed Chair/Empire Innovation Professor&nbsp; $25,000.00 \n<br>Presidential Forum on Health Disparities&nbsp; $12,000.00\n<br>Venue rental with audio/visual&nbsp; $2,500.00 \n<br>CEMHD newsletter translation services&nbsp; $1,200.00 \n<br>Printing costs for newsletter&nbsp; $2,500.00\n<br>Office supplies&nbsp; $2,000.00 \n<br>Mail/Postage&nbsp; $500.00\n<br>Computers/printers&nbsp; $5,000.00 \n<br>Rapid copy&nbsp; $1,000.00 \n<br>Catering&nbsp; $3,500.00\n<br>NIH funded S-21 Total&nbsp; $620,851.34\n<br>\n<br>Projected expenditures from Hearst Foundation\n<br>Tuition &amp; fees (NYS rate) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&nbsp; $75,543.75\n<br>Stipend (no fringe) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&nbsp;&nbsp; $106,182.00 \n<br>Travel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&nbsp;&nbsp; $10,000.00\n<br>Travel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&#39; Primary mentors&nbsp; $10,000.00 \n<br>Travel for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&#39; Rotational mentors&nbsp; $2,500.00\n<br>Overhead fee (7.5%) to transfer stipend money from UAF to IFR&nbsp; $7,963.65\n<br>Hearst Foundation Total&nbsp; $212,189.40</div>","stateHeadcount":"3","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"1.8","rfNumber":"","proposals1":"1","proposals2":"","proposals3":"1","awards1":"1","awards2":"","awards3":"1","largeScale1":"1","largeScale2":"1","sttrAwards1":"0","sttrAwards2":"0","publication1":"","publication2":"","publication3":"40","technologyTransfer1":"0","technologyTransfer2":"0","technologyTransfer3":"0","technologyTransfer4":"0","technologyTransfer5":"0","technologyTransfer6":"0","technologyTransfer7":"0","conference":"40","educationAndTraining1":"2","educationAndTraining2":"","educationAndTraining3":"9","educationAndTraining4":"","goal1":"<div>Provide continuing support to Health Disparities Fellows in the form of stipends, tuition and fees, writing and statistics support, and conference travel support.

In addition, $68,294 in At-Risk Funding was returned by the budget office to our IFR account. Finally, total state overhead paid on these awards was $64,927. Taking all these factors into account, our net revenue for CTG FY 2021-2022 was $582,539. The remaining revenue helped to support annual operating expenses of $435,025. The expense categories included phones, technical equipment and software, postage, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online and in-person training and conferences, non-project supported travel, state project-related expenses, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. This figure also includes fringe for all non-student categories. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,000. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. CTG’s PSR state allocation of $680,857supported 6.34 FTEs. This was reduced by $176,318 from last year’s state allocation of $857,175 and 8 FTEs in order to help support the state-side budget deficit. Due to these reductions in state supported PSR, this year CTG needed to use IFR funds to support 2 research-related positions in order to continue the work needed on various research awards, including a researcher in digital government and a program associate. CTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $923,419 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures (Phase II) award for $349,945 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation (Part 2) award for $39,000. Total new state awards equaled $388,945. New awards through the Research Foundation included a 3-year Message Design Dashboard: Development of a Standardized Messaging Tool through FEMA at $327,012 for year 1. Also, the City of Schenectady awarded the project, Enabling the State-Wide Rollout of the Share Regional Information Resource in the amount of $189,462. The NYS Association of Counties awarded CTG $16,000 to develop a Cyber Primer for local IT leaders. In addition, we received a gift in kind from NVIDIA to provide equipment and training for the TAF project already underway and is valued at approximately $2,000. Total New RF awards equaled $923,419. In addition, CTG has two proposals pending including the NSF Large-scale CoPe: Bridging Data to Action - Using Data and AI to Develop Equitable Outcomes While Augmenting Resilience to Climate Hazards in Coastal Communities for $864,923. Also submitted was a proposal to NSF for the Civic Innovation Challenge 2022 Planning Grant in coordination with the City of Schenectady for $50,000. Total potential new revenue awarded in the coming fiscal year totals $914,923. Residual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support for the two temporary research IFR funded positions mentioned above, including our Researcher in Digital Government, as well as our Program Associate.

Some of these priorities revolve around the topics of artificial intelligence, data analytics, emergency preparedness and response, cybersecurity, and digital inclusion.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Calls from federal agencies are increasingly interdisciplinary and CTG UAlbany is in a unique position to contribute to the socio-technical aspects of information and technology in government. Two future project proposals are taking advantage of the opportunities above. First, we are currently involved in a research proposal led by Texas A&amp;M to the National Science Foundation focused on using Artificial Intelligence to improving equitable outcomes in coastal community resilience processes. Second, on the topic of elections infrastructure security and resiliency, CTG UAlbany has led three projects and another is under development for the coming year. Similarly, in the broader topic of cybersecurity, and in partnership with UAlbany CEHC and Albany Law, industry experts, and state and local governments, we are planning new projects to help state and local government better understand cybersecurity threats.\n<br>\n<br>Although the pandemic has been considered a challenge for many, we are seeing it as an opportunity as well. Public organizations are starting to realize that technology is a core component of their daily operations. CTG UAlbany can play a role in supporting these organizations. In addition, the confirmation that the US workforce is falling behind competitors in digital skills, which also affects government organizations, represents an opportunity to develop digital leaders, which can be done through workshops and customized activities as well as through the Information and Technology Management concentration in the UAlbany’s MPA program.\n<br></div>","bigChallenges":"<div>The university financial constraints, which impact our ability to attract and retain talent, but also to generate knowledge in a sustainable way, given that short term and soft positions as well as part-time ones result in high rotation and the need for retraining.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The lack of awareness and, therefore, visibility and recognition, of what CTG UAlbany does at the university level. For example, most of our staff can be considered professional researchers and some publish and do work equivalent to that of associate professors in academic departments. As an added contribution, these researchers also use their academic work to build networks and to support the work of public organizations. The significance and impact of what they do has greatly contributed to position CTG UAlbany internationally.\n<br>\n<br>Although funding agencies encourage interdisciplinarity, most calls are focused on the technical components of research topics. CTG UAlbany’s socio-technical approach to information and technology in government requires us to partner with other organizations, which expands our networks, but it is also costly and time consuming.\n<br></div>","resourceNeeds":"<div>NA</div>","strategicSuggestions":"<div>Continue to invest in support for proposal development and pre and post award support in general.

To achieve this mission, CTG UAlbany pursues the following strategic actions:\n<br>\n<br>• To engage in innovative academic and applied research on complex societal challenges\n<br>• To become global leaders in digital government research and public sector digital transformation \n<br>• To develop and teach innovative courses that emphasize real-life applications of technology, management, policy, and data in the public sector\n<br>• To enable students to learn about societal challenges and apply technologies and policies in the context of specific projects \n<br>• To engage diverse professional communities in the transformation of public services\n<br>\n<br>CTG UAlbany&#39;s competitive advantage:\n<br>\n<br>• Unique combination of disciplines (public administration and public management, computer science, information systems, data science, business, international relations) \n<br>• Highly skilled academic and professional staff, who help bridge the gap between academia and practice by addressing public problems that are academically significant and practically relevant\n<br>• Network orchestrator, locally (government organizations, diverse stakeholders) and internationally (leader of multiple research networks)\n<br>• Co-creation approach in projects with government organizations that enable their engagement in creative problem-solving processes and the implementation of innovative and customized digital transformation solutions to complex problems\n<br>• “Center for Technology in Government” as a worldwide recognized “brand” developed and consolidated during the last 30 years\n<br>• Key location, close to decision-makers and international hubs\n<br></div>","annualBudget":"<div>CTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG will realize $429,245 in IFR revenue from seven RF projects and $265,182 from four state-side MOUs and contracts. Due to an overpayment on our Water Quality project by the sponsor, $115,255 of these funds were returned to the DEC. In addition, $68,294 in At-Risk Funding was returned by the budget office to our IFR account. Finally, total state overhead paid on these awards was $64,927. Taking all these factors into account, our net revenue for CTG FY 2021-2022 was $582,539. The remaining revenue helped to support annual operating expenses of $435,025. The expense categories included phones, technical equipment and software, postage, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online and in-person training and conferences, non-project supported travel, state project-related expenses, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. This figure also includes fringe for all non-student categories. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,000. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. CTG’s PSR state allocation of $680,857supported 6.34 FTEs. This was reduced by $176,318 from last year’s state allocation of $857,175 and 8 FTEs in order to help support the state-side budget deficit. Due to these reductions in state supported PSR, this year CTG needed to use IFR funds to support 2 research-related positions in order to continue the work needed on various research awards, including a researcher in digital government and a program associate. CTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $923,419 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures (Phase II) award for $349,945 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation (Part 2) award for $39,000. Total new state awards equaled $388,945. New awards through the Research Foundation included a 3-year Message Design Dashboard: Development of a Standardized Messaging Tool through FEMA at $327,012 for year 1. Also, the City of Schenectady awarded the project, Enabling the State-Wide Rollout of the Share Regional Information Resource in the amount of $189,462. The NYS Association of Counties awarded CTG $16,000 to develop a Cyber Primer for local IT leaders. In addition, we received a gift in kind from NVIDIA to provide equipment and training for the TAF project already underway and is valued at approximately $2,000. Total New RF awards equaled $923,419. In addition, CTG has two proposals pending including the NSF Large-scale CoPe: Bridging Data to Action - Using Data and AI to Develop Equitable Outcomes While Augmenting Resilience to Climate Hazards in Coastal Communities for $864,923. Also submitted was a proposal to NSF for the Civic Innovation Challenge 2022 Planning Grant in coordination with the City of Schenectady for $50,000. Total potential new revenue awarded in the coming fiscal year totals $914,923. Residual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support for the two temporary research IFR funded positions mentioned above, including our Researcher in Digital Government, as well as our Program Associate.&nbsp; </div>","stateHeadcount":"11","rfHeadcount":"0","stateNumber":"10.25","rfNumber":"0","proposals1":"2","proposals2":"2","proposals3":"1","awards1":"1","awards2":"1","awards3":"0","largeScale1":"1","largeScale2":"0","sttrAwards1":"0","sttrAwards2":"0","publication1":"1","publication2":"0","publication3":"10","technologyTransfer1":"1","technologyTransfer2":"0","technologyTransfer3":"0","technologyTransfer4":"0","technologyTransfer5":"0","technologyTransfer6":"0","technologyTransfer7":"0","conference":"14","educationAndTraining1":"3","educationAndTraining2":"2","educationAndTraining3":"10","educationAndTraining4":"1","goal1":"<div>Engage in innovative research and problem solving projects that address societal challenges </div>","goal2":"<div>Develop and teach innovative courses that integrate teaching and experiential education Continue to design and teach courses as part of the Rock College Information Technology and Management (ITM) Program. </div>","goal3":"<div>Provide students with internships that allow hands on learning through projects that address real world challenges and explore and develop innovative and sustainable solutions.\n<br>\n<br></div>","goal4":"<div>Continue to be global leaders in digital government research.</div>","goal5":"Continue to be sought after advisers on information policy, management, and technology innovations that advance efforts to address societal challenges.","actions1":"<div>Strategically plan for and submit 5 research and other project proposals and contracts.</div>","actions2":"<div>Continue to design and teach courses as part of the Rock College Information Technology and Management (ITM) Program. </div>","actions3":"<div>Provide paid and academic internships for 15 UAlbany students through our Student Innovation Lab Experience (STILE) program and other funded research and projects. </div>","actions4":"<div>Produce 14 high quality academic and practitioner publications based on CTG research.</div>","actions5":"<div>Continue to serve and accept invitations to serve as advisors for local, state, federal, and international government and research groups.</div>","metrics1":"Five applications processed.","metrics2":"","metrics3":"<div>Train 15 students. </div>","metrics4":"Produce 10 high quality academic and practitioner publications based on CTG research.","metrics5":"Participate in 14 invited keynotes and other presentations.
