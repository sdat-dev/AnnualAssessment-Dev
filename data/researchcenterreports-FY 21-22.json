Over the past five years, ASRC’s payroll expenditures totaled $10,706,372 – an average of $2,141,274 per year. One full-time research facilitator and one part-time IT support person are supported by the VPR. Post-docs, research scientists, visiting scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students are primarily paid from research grants; some are supported from start-up funds provided to SUNY2020 faculty. Most ASRC faculty are on 9-month academic year appointments and are paid summer salary from research grants or start-up funds. OTPS: ASRC’s operations, including operations at the UAlbany location and at Whiteface Mountain, are covered by IFR revenue recovered from sponsored programs. Over the past five years, ASRC’s OTPS expenditures at the Albany location have totaled $202,696, an average of $40,539 per year. Not counting annual telephone charges of almost $19,000 per year, OTPS expenses at ASRC average about $21,539 per year. The Whiteface location’s OTPS expenditures over five years total $77,606, an average of $15,521 per year. One faculty member had a legacy IFR account that covered some OTPS expenses such as Verizon Wireless. Strategic Investment: In the past, ASRC has received overhead recovery from the VPR to be used to grow research activity at ASRC. We have about $70,900 remaining in cash to spend on the state-side. On the RF side there is a legacy overhead recovery account primarily used in support of our RF p-card program as the initial source to pay the Bank of America bill monthly; expenses are then moved to the appropriate sponsored award through a reconciliation process.

Home to a 2016 NIMHD S21 Health Disparities Endowment Grant, a 2009 NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center of Excellence, and a 2004 NIMHD R24 EXPORT Center, CEMHD works toward eliminating health disparities by developing capacity in faculty at the University at Albany and partnering with community groups to identify their health concerns and the sources of disparities, and then plans, implements and tests strategies to alleviate them. CEMHD is a partnership among community groups, hospitals, state and county health departments, the State of New York and the University at Albany. CEMHD&#39;s focus on minorities and under-served populations in the smaller cities and towns of Upstate New York is premised upon the notion that health disparities found in these areas differ from those in the larger cities, and that the appropriate solutions will also differ. Since most of the research on minority health disparities, and the programs that have resulted from it, has focused on populations in large cities, relatively little is known about the distinct causes of poorer health among minorities in smaller cities. Therefore, another reason for our geographical emphasis is to fill in a gap in the research and to initiate and test the appropriate solutions. </div>","annualBudget":"Projected CEMHD ANNUAL Expenditures\nProjected expenditures from NIH funded S-21                                                         \nStipend and fringe for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $143,982.90 \nTuition and fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $91,966.09\nTravel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows  $12,000.00 \nTravel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Primary mentors  $12,000.00\nTravel for 6 Health Disparities Fellows' Rotational mentors  $3,000.00 \nWriting support for Health Disparities Fellows  $7,890.00\nStatistical support for Health Disparities Fellows (grad student)  $6,698.64 \nSupport for advancing MHD research (grad student)  $11,164.40\nSupport for collaboration/recruitment platform development (grad student)  $24,091.60 \nLogistical support & Task Force liaison (grad student)  $25,854.40\nAssociate Director of Operations and Research   $129,535.81 \nSupport for Community Task Force   $25,000.00\nAlbany Task Force Convener   $5,000.00 \nAmsterdam Task Force Convener  $8,017.50\nDirector's stipend   $39,450.00 \nDirector Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 Course releases  $20,000.00 \nEndowed Chair/Empire Innovation Professor  $25,000.00 \nPresidential Forum on Health Disparities  $12,000.00\nVenue rental with audio/visual  $2,500.00 \nCEMHD newsletter translation services  $1,200.00 \nPrinting costs for newsletter  $2,500.00\nOffice supplies  $2,000.00 \nMail/Postage  $500.00\nComputers/printers  $5,000.00 \nRapid copy  $1,000.00 \nCatering  $3,500.00\nNIH funded S-21 Total  $620,851.34\n\nProjected expenditures from Hearst Foundation\nTuition & fees (NYS rate) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows  $75,543.75\nStipend (no fringe) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows   $106,182.00 \nTravel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows   $10,000.00\nTravel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Primary mentors  $10,000.00 \nTravel for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows' Rotational mentors  $2,500.00\nOverhead fee (7.5%) to transfer stipend money from UAF to IFR  $7,963.65\nHearst Foundation Total  $212,189.40\n","stateHeadcount":"3","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"1.8","rfNumber":"","additionalAmount1":"","additionalSource1":"","additionalAmount2":"","additionalSource2":"","additionalAmount3":"","additionalSource3":"","federalApplicationsGoal":"1","privateApplicationsGoal":"1","stateApplicationsGoal":"","federalApplicationsActual":"1","privateApplicationsActual":"1","stateApplicationsActual":"","federalAwardsGoal":"1","privateAwardsGoal":"1","stateAwardsGoal":"","federalAwardsActual":"","privateAwardsActual":"1","stateAwardsActual":"","lsProposalsGoal":"n/a","lsProposalsActual":"","lsAwardsGoal":"n/a","lsAwardsActual":"","sttrProposalsGoal":"","sttrProposalsActual":"","sttrAwardssGoal":"","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"","booksAuthoredActual":"","bookChaptersGoal":"","bookChaptersActual":"","publicationsGoal":"","publicationsActual":"42","listOfPublications":"<div>In Press Peer Reviewed Publications (Health Disparity Training Fellows (HDTFS) \n<br>\n<br>1.\tKalu O, Bhatia R (in press).

The keynote speech by Dr. Camara Phyllis Jones, a national expert on equity and health issues, “Achieving Health Equity: Naming Racism and Moving to Action” focused on the social and behavioral factors influencing racial differences on health outcomes and quality of life for African Americans. There were 231 registrations and 131 attendees, including Community partners, government officials, researchers, faculty, professional staff, postdoctoral associates, and students. This year’s Forum included, in addition to the keynote speaker and reaction panel, 3 concurrent panels, organized around the topics of Environmental Health Disparities, Maternal Health Disparities, and Health Communication, Digital Divide, and Messaging. Each panel featured 3 faculty researchers, as well as a community based practitioner.\n<br></div>","topAchievements4":"<div>Strengthening community outreach, information dissemination, public engagement, and action related to health disparities research. \n<br>\n<br>a. The CEMHD supports two local community task forces in Albany and Amsterdam, NY dedicated to community-researcher partnerships to address health disparities. Regular members include community leaders from these areas, mostly affiliated with governmental and non-governmental organizations dedicated to health and human services, and researchers from the University at Albany. Members of these task forces work together to identify causes and possible solutions for health disparities in the area, develop research projects to document these health disparities, and provide guidance and feedback on research projects in these communities. Both convene approximately once a month. The Albany Minority Health Task Force is mostly focused on the needs of African Americans and the poor in the city of Albany. The Amsterdam Minority Health Task Force focuses on the needs of migrants, non-English speakers (particularly Spanish speakers), mothers, and the elderly in the more rural region of Montgomery and Fulton counties of New York. \n<br>b. In 2020-2021, the Albany Minority Health Task Force, in collaboration with faculty from UAlbany and support from the University at Albany COVID-19 and MHD in NYS Engaged Researchers (ER) Group, designed and executed a survey to document the local impact of COVID-19 on communities of color. The report can be found in an open-access repository through the UAlbany Library’s Scholar’s Archive. In June 2021, CEMHD researchers presented survey results at the 2021 Summer Symposium - Differential Impacts of COVID-19 in NYS.\n<br>c. HDTFs participate in the community health task forces to develop the Fellows’ organizational and operational skills and qualifications as community engaged health disparities researcher, thus aiding in the acquisition of a professional position. Almost every Task Force meeting in 2021-2022 was attended by at least one Fellow. CEMHD continues to work on increasing outreach and communication to local and larger communities through our web presence within the UAlbany Website and through social media outlets. The website hosts both publications in health disparities for our Fellows and Associates, and any upcoming events that our HDTFs and Associates are involved in. Our quarterly CEMHD Newsletter/Bulletin is emailed to stakeholders and also available on our website. The Newsletter/Bulletin showcases achievements by Associates and Fellows, and highlights accomplishments of our Amsterdam and Albany Minority Health Task Forces. We also use social media, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\n<br></div>","topAchievements5":"<div>Contributing to elevating the visibility of minority health disparities and health equity achievement as a central theme and signature strength of the University, such that training and research in this area will be ongoing for the foreseeable future, with S21 supported activities playing a central role. \n<br>\n<br>The NIMHD S21 Endowment Program – particularly through its President’s Forum and Speakers Series – continues to raise the visibility of the University at Albany as a hub for health disparities research, training, and community outreach throughout Albany County, the greater Capital Region, the State of New York, and the northeastern United States.

Together, the Hearst award and the S-21 endowment are now supporting a transdisciplinary doctoral fellowship program for 16 doctoral students from public health, social sciences, biological sciences, social welfare, and counseling psychology. Center staff are working to address administrative challenges accompanying this expansion while continuing to innovate to support the Fellows in their home departments, while ensuring that they receive the transdisciplinary training that is a signature strength of the fellowship program.

for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities (CEMHD) is to contribute to the elimination of minority health disparities in the smaller cities and towns of New York State. CEMHD’s activities focus on three major interrelated areas, in the service of contributing to the elimination of minority health disparities: community engagement, fostering health disparities research, and supporting the development of new health disparities scholars.</div>","vision":"<div>The Center for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities (CEMHD), is a collaborative effort focusing on minority health disparities in the smaller cities and towns of New York. Home to a 2016 NIMHD S21 Health Disparities Endowment Grant, a 2009 NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center of Excellence, and a 2004 NIMHD R24 EXPORT Center, CEMHD works toward eliminating health disparities by developing capacity in faculty at the University at Albany and partnering with community groups to identify their health concerns and the sources of disparities, and then plans, implements and tests strategies to alleviate them. CEMHD is a partnership among community groups, hospitals, state and county health departments, the State of New York and the University at Albany. CEMHD&#39;s focus on minorities and under-served populations in the smaller cities and towns of Upstate New York is premised upon the notion that health disparities found in these areas differ from those in the larger cities, and that the appropriate solutions will also differ. Since most of the research on minority health disparities, and the programs that have resulted from it, has focused on populations in large cities, relatively little is known about the distinct causes of poorer health among minorities in smaller cities. Therefore, another reason for our geographical emphasis is to fill in a gap in the research and to initiate and test the appropriate solutions. </div>","annualBudget":"<div>Projected CEMHD ANNUAL Expenditures\n<br>Projected expenditures from NIH funded S-21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<br>Stipend and fringe for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&nbsp; $143,982.90 \n<br>Tuition and fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&nbsp; $91,966.09\n<br>Travel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&nbsp; $12,000.00 \n<br>Travel and membership fees for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&#39; Primary mentors&nbsp; $12,000.00\n<br>Travel for 6 Health Disparities Fellows&#39; Rotational mentors&nbsp; $3,000.00 \n<br>Writing support for Health Disparities Fellows&nbsp; $7,890.00\n<br>Statistical support for Health Disparities Fellows (grad student)&nbsp; $6,698.64 \n<br>Support for advancing MHD research (grad student)&nbsp; $11,164.40\n<br>Support for collaboration/recruitment platform development (grad student)&nbsp; $24,091.60 \n<br>Logistical support &amp; Task Force liaison (grad student)&nbsp; $25,854.40\n<br>Associate Director of Operations and Research&nbsp;&nbsp; $129,535.81 \n<br>Support for Community Task Force&nbsp;&nbsp; $25,000.00\n<br>Albany Task Force Convener&nbsp;&nbsp; $5,000.00 \n<br>Amsterdam Task Force Convener&nbsp; $8,017.50\n<br>Director&#39;s stipend&nbsp;&nbsp; $39,450.00 \n<br>Director Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 Course releases&nbsp; $20,000.00 \n<br>Endowed Chair/Empire Innovation Professor&nbsp; $25,000.00 \n<br>Presidential Forum on Health Disparities&nbsp; $12,000.00\n<br>Venue rental with audio/visual&nbsp; $2,500.00 \n<br>CEMHD newsletter translation services&nbsp; $1,200.00 \n<br>Printing costs for newsletter&nbsp; $2,500.00\n<br>Office supplies&nbsp; $2,000.00 \n<br>Mail/Postage&nbsp; $500.00\n<br>Computers/printers&nbsp; $5,000.00 \n<br>Rapid copy&nbsp; $1,000.00 \n<br>Catering&nbsp; $3,500.00\n<br>NIH funded S-21 Total&nbsp; $620,851.34\n<br>\n<br>Projected expenditures from Hearst Foundation\n<br>Tuition &amp; fees (NYS rate) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&nbsp; $75,543.75\n<br>Stipend (no fringe) for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&nbsp;&nbsp; $106,182.00 \n<br>Travel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&nbsp;&nbsp; $10,000.00\n<br>Travel and membership fees for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&#39; Primary mentors&nbsp; $10,000.00 \n<br>Travel for 5 Hearst Foundation Fellows&#39; Rotational mentors&nbsp; $2,500.00\n<br>Overhead fee (7.5%) to transfer stipend money from UAF to IFR&nbsp; $7,963.65\n<br>Hearst Foundation Total&nbsp; $212,189.40</div>","stateHeadcount":"3","rfHeadcount":"","stateNumber":"1.8","rfNumber":"","proposals1":"1","proposals2":"","proposals3":"1","awards1":"1","awards2":"","awards3":"1","largeScale1":"1","largeScale2":"1","sttrAwards1":"0","sttrAwards2":"0","publication1":"","publication2":"","publication3":"40","technologyTransfer1":"0","technologyTransfer2":"0","technologyTransfer3":"0","technologyTransfer4":"0","technologyTransfer5":"0","technologyTransfer6":"0","technologyTransfer7":"0","conference":"40","educationAndTraining1":"2","educationAndTraining2":"","educationAndTraining3":"9","educationAndTraining4":"","goal1":"<div>Provide continuing support to Health Disparities Fellows in the form of stipends, tuition and fees, writing and statistics support, and conference travel support.

It soon developed into an internationally-recognized research center within the University at Albany whose mission is to foster public sector innovation, enhance capability, generate public value, and support good governance. To achieve this mission, CTG UAlbany pursues the following strategic actions:\n<br>\n<br>• To engage in innovative academic and applied research on complex societal challenges\n<br>• To become global leaders in digital government research and public sector digital transformation \n<br>• To develop and teach innovative courses that emphasize real-life applications of technology, management, policy, and data in the public sector\n<br>• To enable students to learn about societal challenges and apply technologies and policies in the context of specific projects \n<br>• To engage diverse professional communities in the transformation of public services\n<br>\n<br>CTG UAlbany&#39;s competitive advantage:\n<br>\n<br>• Unique combination of disciplines (public administration and public management, computer science, information systems, data science, business, international relations) \n<br>• Highly skilled academic and professional staff, who help bridge the gap between academia and practice by addressing public problems that are academically significant and practically relevant\n<br>• Network orchestrator, locally (government organizations, diverse stakeholders) and internationally (leader of multiple research networks)\n<br>• Co-creation approach in projects with government organizations that enable their engagement in creative problem-solving processes and the implementation of innovative and customized digital transformation solutions to complex problems\n<br>• “Center for Technology in Government” as a worldwide recognized “brand” developed and consolidated during the last 30 years\n<br>• Key location, close to decision-makers and international hubs\n<br></div>","annualBudget":"CTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG will realize $429,245 in IFR revenue from seven RF projects and $265,182 from four state-side MOUs and contracts. Due to an overpayment on our Water Quality project by the sponsor, $115,255 of these funds were returned to the DEC. In addition, $68,294 in At-Risk Funding was returned by the budget office to our IFR account. Finally, total state overhead paid on these awards was $64,927. Taking all these factors into account, our net revenue for CTG FY 2021-2022 was $582,539. The remaining revenue helped to support annual operating expenses of $435,025. The expense categories included phones, technical equipment and software, postage, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online and in-person training and conferences, non-project supported travel, state project-related expenses, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. This figure also includes fringe for all non-student categories. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,000. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. CTG’s PSR state allocation of $680,857supported 6.34 FTEs. This was reduced by $176,318 from last year’s state allocation of $857,175 and 8 FTEs in order to help support the state-side budget deficit. Due to these reductions in state supported PSR, this year CTG needed to use IFR funds to support 2 research-related positions in order to continue the work needed on various research awards, including a researcher in digital government and a program associate. CTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $923,419 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures (Phase II) award for $349,945 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation (Part 2) award for $39,000. Total new state awards equaled $388,945. New awards through the Research Foundation included a 3-year Message Design Dashboard: Development of a Standardized Messaging Tool through FEMA at $327,012 for year 1. Also, the City of Schenectady awarded the project, Enabling the State-Wide Rollout of the Share Regional Information Resource in the amount of $189,462. The NYS Association of Counties awarded CTG $16,000 to develop a Cyber Primer for local IT leaders. In addition, we received a gift in kind from NVIDIA to provide equipment and training for the TAF project already underway and is valued at approximately $2,000. Total New RF awards equaled $923,419. In addition, CTG has two proposals pending including the NSF Large-scale CoPe: Bridging Data to Action - Using Data and AI to Develop Equitable Outcomes While Augmenting Resilience to Climate Hazards in Coastal Communities for $864,923. Also submitted was a proposal to NSF for the Civic Innovation Challenge 2022 Planning Grant in coordination with the City of Schenectady for $50,000. Total potential new revenue awarded in the coming fiscal year totals $914,923. Residual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support for the two temporary research IFR funded positions mentioned above, including our Researcher in Digital Government, as well as our Program Associate.

Some of these priorities revolve around the topics of artificial intelligence, data analytics, emergency preparedness and response, cybersecurity, and digital inclusion.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Calls from federal agencies are increasingly interdisciplinary and CTG UAlbany is in a unique position to contribute to the socio-technical aspects of information and technology in government. Two future project proposals are taking advantage of the opportunities above. First, we are currently involved in a research proposal led by Texas A&amp;M to the National Science Foundation focused on using Artificial Intelligence to improving equitable outcomes in coastal community resilience processes. Second, on the topic of elections infrastructure security and resiliency, CTG UAlbany has led three projects and another is under development for the coming year. Similarly, in the broader topic of cybersecurity, and in partnership with UAlbany CEHC and Albany Law, industry experts, and state and local governments, we are planning new projects to help state and local government better understand cybersecurity threats.\n<br>\n<br>Although the pandemic has been considered a challenge for many, we are seeing it as an opportunity as well. Public organizations are starting to realize that technology is a core component of their daily operations. CTG UAlbany can play a role in supporting these organizations. In addition, the confirmation that the US workforce is falling behind competitors in digital skills, which also affects government organizations, represents an opportunity to develop digital leaders, which can be done through workshops and customized activities as well as through the Information and Technology Management concentration in the UAlbany’s MPA program.\n<br></div>","bigChallenges":"<div>The university financial constraints, which impact our ability to attract and retain talent, but also to generate knowledge in a sustainable way, given that short term and soft positions as well as part-time ones result in high rotation and the need for retraining.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The lack of awareness and, therefore, visibility and recognition, of what CTG UAlbany does at the university level. For example, most of our staff can be considered professional researchers and some publish and do work equivalent to that of associate professors in academic departments. As an added contribution, these researchers also use their academic work to build networks and to support the work of public organizations. The significance and impact of what they do has greatly contributed to position CTG UAlbany internationally.\n<br>\n<br>Although funding agencies encourage interdisciplinarity, most calls are focused on the technical components of research topics. CTG UAlbany’s socio-technical approach to information and technology in government requires us to partner with other organizations, which expands our networks, but it is also costly and time consuming.\n<br></div>","resourceNeeds":"<div>NA</div>","strategicSuggestions":"<div>Continue to invest in support for proposal development and pre and post award support in general.

To achieve this mission, CTG UAlbany pursues the following strategic actions:\n<br>\n<br>• To engage in innovative academic and applied research on complex societal challenges\n<br>• To become global leaders in digital government research and public sector digital transformation \n<br>• To develop and teach innovative courses that emphasize real-life applications of technology, management, policy, and data in the public sector\n<br>• To enable students to learn about societal challenges and apply technologies and policies in the context of specific projects \n<br>• To engage diverse professional communities in the transformation of public services\n<br>\n<br>CTG UAlbany&#39;s competitive advantage:\n<br>\n<br>• Unique combination of disciplines (public administration and public management, computer science, information systems, data science, business, international relations) \n<br>• Highly skilled academic and professional staff, who help bridge the gap between academia and practice by addressing public problems that are academically significant and practically relevant\n<br>• Network orchestrator, locally (government organizations, diverse stakeholders) and internationally (leader of multiple research networks)\n<br>• Co-creation approach in projects with government organizations that enable their engagement in creative problem-solving processes and the implementation of innovative and customized digital transformation solutions to complex problems\n<br>• “Center for Technology in Government” as a worldwide recognized “brand” developed and consolidated during the last 30 years\n<br>• Key location, close to decision-makers and international hubs\n<br></div>","annualBudget":"<div>CTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG will realize $429,245 in IFR revenue from seven RF projects and $265,182 from four state-side MOUs and contracts. Due to an overpayment on our Water Quality project by the sponsor, $115,255 of these funds were returned to the DEC. In addition, $68,294 in At-Risk Funding was returned by the budget office to our IFR account. Finally, total state overhead paid on these awards was $64,927. Taking all these factors into account, our net revenue for CTG FY 2021-2022 was $582,539. The remaining revenue helped to support annual operating expenses of $435,025. The expense categories included phones, technical equipment and software, postage, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online and in-person training and conferences, non-project supported travel, state project-related expenses, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. This figure also includes fringe for all non-student categories. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,000. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. CTG’s PSR state allocation of $680,857supported 6.34 FTEs. This was reduced by $176,318 from last year’s state allocation of $857,175 and 8 FTEs in order to help support the state-side budget deficit. Due to these reductions in state supported PSR, this year CTG needed to use IFR funds to support 2 research-related positions in order to continue the work needed on various research awards, including a researcher in digital government and a program associate. CTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $923,419 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures (Phase II) award for $349,945 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation (Part 2) award for $39,000. Total new state awards equaled $388,945. New awards through the Research Foundation included a 3-year Message Design Dashboard: Development of a Standardized Messaging Tool through FEMA at $327,012 for year 1. Also, the City of Schenectady awarded the project, Enabling the State-Wide Rollout of the Share Regional Information Resource in the amount of $189,462. The NYS Association of Counties awarded CTG $16,000 to develop a Cyber Primer for local IT leaders. In addition, we received a gift in kind from NVIDIA to provide equipment and training for the TAF project already underway and is valued at approximately $2,000. Total New RF awards equaled $923,419. In addition, CTG has two proposals pending including the NSF Large-scale CoPe: Bridging Data to Action - Using Data and AI to Develop Equitable Outcomes While Augmenting Resilience to Climate Hazards in Coastal Communities for $864,923. Also submitted was a proposal to NSF for the Civic Innovation Challenge 2022 Planning Grant in coordination with the City of Schenectady for $50,000. Total potential new revenue awarded in the coming fiscal year totals $914,923. Residual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support for the two temporary research IFR funded positions mentioned above, including our Researcher in Digital Government, as well as our Program Associate.&nbsp; </div>","stateHeadcount":"11","rfHeadcount":"0","stateNumber":"10.25","rfNumber":"0","proposals1":"2","proposals2":"2","proposals3":"1","awards1":"1","awards2":"1","awards3":"0","largeScale1":"1","largeScale2":"0","sttrAwards1":"0","sttrAwards2":"0","publication1":"1","publication2":"0","publication3":"10","technologyTransfer1":"1","technologyTransfer2":"0","technologyTransfer3":"0","technologyTransfer4":"0","technologyTransfer5":"0","technologyTransfer6":"0","technologyTransfer7":"0","conference":"14","educationAndTraining1":"3","educationAndTraining2":"2","educationAndTraining3":"10","educationAndTraining4":"1","goal1":"<div>Engage in innovative research and problem solving projects that address societal challenges </div>","goal2":"<div>Develop and teach innovative courses that integrate teaching and experiential education Continue to design and teach courses as part of the Rock College Information Technology and Management (ITM) Program. </div>","goal3":"<div>Provide students with internships that allow hands on learning through projects that address real world challenges and explore and develop innovative and sustainable solutions.\n<br>\n<br></div>","goal4":"<div>Continue to be global leaders in digital government research.</div>","goal5":"Continue to be sought after advisers on information policy, management, and technology innovations that advance efforts to address societal challenges.","actions1":"<div>Strategically plan for and submit 5 research and other project proposals and contracts.</div>","actions2":"<div>Continue to design and teach courses as part of the Rock College Information Technology and Management (ITM) Program. </div>","actions3":"<div>Provide paid and academic internships for 15 UAlbany students through our Student Innovation Lab Experience (STILE) program and other funded research and projects. </div>","actions4":"<div>Produce 14 high quality academic and practitioner publications based on CTG research.</div>","actions5":"<div>Continue to serve and accept invitations to serve as advisors for local, state, federal, and international government and research groups.</div>","metrics1":"Five applications processed.","metrics2":"","metrics3":"<div>Train 15 students. </div>","metrics4":"Produce 10 high quality academic and practitioner publications based on CTG research.","metrics5":"Participate in 14 invited keynotes and other presentations.
