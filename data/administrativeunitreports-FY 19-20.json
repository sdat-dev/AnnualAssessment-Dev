After 3 ideation workshops, four groups submitted white papers. \n\n2. The Office for Faculty Development initiated a seed funding, the Next Research Frontiers (NeRF), program to assist faculty members who have been actively seeking extramural grants. Based on the number of proposals submitted by a faculty member over the previous 24-months, nineteen researchers were given “medallions” worth $15K, $7.5K, and $5K. They were encouraged to formulate small group interdisciplinary research projects and submit extramural grant proposals. \n\n3. Another seed funding initiative, to inculcate joint projects and collaborations among UAlbany faculty working in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security (AICSI) initiative, was developed.

Germination Space initiative on Internet of Things: This is primarily a SUNY initiative but the Faculty Research Development Office coordinated the program at UAlbany. Fifteen faculty members were selected to attend three workshop to help them germinate ideas and form four teams that eventually prepared white papers. The white papers were reviewed by SUNY project PIs and awarded $25K, $8.5K, $8.5K, and $8.5K, on July 16, 2019, to develop federal funding\nproposals within the following 11 months.

It was attended by about 72 participants. All talks were of high caliber and well received.\n\nii. AICS Seed Funding Initiative was launched on March 20 and encouraged researchers to form teams to write white papers to compete for up to $25K in seed funding. Six white papers were received and reviewed in May 2020. We are in a process of selecting 2-3 teams for this award to be announced before the end of June 2020.
