After 3 ideation workshops, four groups submitted white papers. \n\n2. The Office for Faculty Development initiated a seed funding, the Next Research Frontiers (NeRF), program to assist faculty members who have been actively seeking extramural grants. Based on the number of proposals submitted by a faculty member over the previous 24-months, nineteen researchers were given “medallions” worth $15K, $7.5K, and $5K. They were encouraged to formulate small group interdisciplinary research projects and submit extramural grant proposals. \n\n3. Another seed funding initiative, to inculcate joint projects and collaborations among UAlbany faculty working in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security (AICSI) initiative, was developed. The goal here is to support groups to apply for extramural grants. Six very competitive proposals were submitted. \n\n4.
