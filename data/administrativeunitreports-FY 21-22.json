The overarching goal of this interdisciplinary collaboration is to promote research synergies, foster knowledge exchange, promote joint publications, grow extramural funding, host research forums and conferences, and eventually build out an overall sustainable and thriving community of interdisciplinary scholars and researchers. This scholarly and research community launched on February 18, 2022 with President Rodríguez, Vice President Kesavadas, and Deans Altarriba (CAS) and Griffin (CEHC) who kicked-off the inaugural meeting.  More than 50 faculty across these academic and research units participated.  A second meeting was held on April 15th and additional forums, symposia and speaker series related events are being promoted to further nurture the growth of the community.\n\n\n2)\tTHE HEALTH EQUITY & DISPARITIES PLATFORM:\nSDAT also partnered with AVP Theresa Pardo, the leader of the universitywide Health Equity & Disparities Engaged Researchers Community to support and grow one of the University’s Signature Strengths (www.albany.edu/researchinitiatives/healthequity).  This research community supports faculty and researchers from across disciplines to address the challenges associated with health inequity and disparities – a scholarly community that meets on a bi-weekly basis (over 25 times last year alone).  The platform specifically supports a number of research and scholarly activities including: the President’s Health Disparities Forum, a Presidential Summer Symposium, the prestigious Empire Innovation Professorship (EIP) search for a pre-eminent leader in health equity and health disparities, the COVID–Minority Health Disparities’ 3-Campus Community Conversation, among others.  The platform also provides a number of scholarly resources for the community including a funder toolkit to help secure extramural funding, researcher profiles to help identify potential collaborators, and access to scholarly papers and data, along with opportunities for collaboration using MS Teams. \n\n\n3)\tTHE AI – CYBER INSTITUTE:  In summer of 2021, SDAT partnered with CEAS Dean Boyer and a dedicated committee to develop an AI-Cyber Institute concept and budget for the President, which was approved and announced last fall.  SDAT has subsequently had preliminary discussions about advancing a scholarly community in support of this universitywide research strength as well.\n\n4)\tMS TEAMS:  SDAT has also advanced a number of project-based communities for specific initiatives using the MS TEAMS collaboration platform.
