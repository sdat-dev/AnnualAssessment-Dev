The reason why CSDA does not show up in the grants is because the Deans of the Colleges and Schools do not allow PIs to give credit to CSDA. Historically this has been the case. \n\nTo compete for center grant funding through the NICHD Population Dynamics Branch (PDB), via -- https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-22-013.html, which is the funding that we have had in the past, what is MOST important is for our CSDA associates to have R01s, R21s, and R03s awarded via PDB. It does not matter whether they are counted as \"\"CSDA\"\" in our PACS system. \n\nTo this end, in the past year, we have significantly increased our awards. We have three active awards:\n1) Chatterji and Strully -- R03 -- \"\"Effects of Medicaid expansions on infant health among Native Americans\"\" -- 5/1/21 -- 4/30/22 -- $154,500\n2) Strully and Appleton -- R21 -- via RAND -- \"\"Assessing individual, community, and financial factors in birth outcomes and associated health disparities\"\" -- 9/15/20 -- 8/31/21 -- $58,438\n3) Markowitz and Chatterji -- R03 -- via NBER -- \"\"An exploratory study of the social and economic determinants of maternal morbidity in the US\"\" -- 8/1/20 -- 7/31/22 -- $100,000\n\nIn addition, we have another that will likely be funded:\n1) Ho and Chatterji -- R03 -- \"\"Effect of losing hospital-based obstetric services on maternal health in rural communities.\"\" -- 7/1/21 -- 6/30/23 -- $100,000 (Impact score 30 -- 15th percentile)\n","undergraduateStudentsGoal":"","graduateStudentsGoal":"","graduatePhdStudentsGoal":"","phdStudentsGoal":"3","undergraduateStudentsActual":"","graduateStudentsActual":"","graduatePhdStudentsActual":"","phdStudentsActual":"","natureOfMentoringUndergradudate":"","natureOfMentoringGraduate":"","natureOfMentoringGraduatePhd":"","natureOfMentoringPhd":"","topAchievements1":"We have three active grants -- two R03s and an R21 subaward -- from the Population Dynamics Branch (PDB) of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). With a few more grants from PDB, CSDA will be competitive for Center grant funding. We have just learned that it's likely another grant (R03) via PDB will likely be funded.\n","topAchievements2":"We have just launched a grant review program to encourage our Associates to apply for more grants via PDB at NICHD. For Associates that are interested, we are offering them the opportunity to have someone from the Executive Committee or an expert outside UAlbany review their grant proposal before the submission date. We hope this will result in more applications to NICHD and more funded applications.\n","topAchievements3":"CSDA provided support to Cornell University's population center in developing their portion a larger NIH R25 program called \"Next GenPop,\" which aims to significantly increase the pipeline of scholars from underrepresented backgrounds entering population science. The first five-year funding cycle of NextGenPop will likely be funded by NICHD (its impact score was a 14) and will include five sites -- Wisconsin, Cornell, Duke, UC-Irvine, and Minnesota. When the funding comes through, CSDA will collaborate directly with Cornell in two ways: 1) recruit underrepresented UAlbany students to participate at the Cornell summer program; and 2) CSDA faculty will participate in training and mentoring the students at the summer program. By working with Cornell, in the future funding cycle, CSDA will be competitive to be a host site, which would bring significant visibility to UAlbany's diversity efforts and result in funding from PDB making CSDA competitive for center grant funding. CSDA partnered with the NYS project on COVID-19/MHD, CEMHD, and CURCE on a StAR proposal to develop an infrastructure here at UAlbany to engage underrepresented undergraduates in minority health disparities research. If funded, this would bolster CSDA's chances to be a host site for the NIH R25 proposal and will help CSDA in applying for an NSF grant for Research Experiences for Undergraduates (NSF 19-582).\n","topAchievements4":"CSDA launched a very successful colloquium series this year. Dr. Courtney Boen from Sociology Department and Population Studies Center of the University of Pennsylvania gave a talk on \"The Roles of State and Local Immigration Policy in Shaping Population Patterns of Health Inequality,\" which was attended by 40 participants. Then we had a micro-sequel event to the very successful RISE conference. It featured a colloquium on \"Challenges and Opportunities for Studying Climate-Related Drivers of Migration\" by Dr. Elizabeth Fussell from the Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University who is the current editor-in-chief of the journal Population and Environment. The colloquium was followed by Lightning talks by Drs. Catherine Lawson, Christopher Thorncroft, and Shao Lin. The event was attended by about 100 participants. The final colloquium was co-sponsored by the Confucius Institute.

We are the ONLY place on campus at UAlbany where graduate students can analyze these rich, restricted data, which include social, environmental, behavioral, and biological data to examine health and chronic diseases over time of a cohort of over 20,000 adolescents who were in grades 7-12 during the 1994-95 school year and have been followed until 2016-2018 (Wave V). We have recently offered \"cold room\" space to a graduate student from the School of Education so that he can work with restricted data from the Department of Education.

Established in 1993, we pursue new ways to use technology to address practical problems of information management and service delivery in government. CTG UAlbany has collaborated with hundreds of domestic and international researchers on understanding and applying emerging technologies. At the same time, CTG UAlbany has worked with scores of local, state, federal, and international government bodies as a trusted advisor and facilitator of management and policy decisions to govern the use of new technologies as tools for public service transformation.","vision":"Work with governments worldwide transforming public services through innovations in technology, policy and management.","annualBudget":"Despite the many challenges resulting from the COVID19 global pandemic, CTG continued to thrive while pursuing its rich and diverse research and project-related activities, working to collaborate with and transform local, state, national, and international governments and communities. As a result of the fiscal challenges created by the pandemic, the University implemented various restrictions, including a budget reduction, spending directives, and a hiring freeze, all which directly impacted CTG. Other challenges for CTG included the disruption of a move from off-campus to a smaller on-campus location which significantly reduced our operational costs, while allowing the university to benefit from an increase in overhead revenue. Three key staff turnovers took place throughout the year and resulted in the loss of 1 FTE in the Research Division. This occurred when our Research Director moved into the Center Director role with no replacement of FTE. CTG adapted to all of these new conditions and continued to work seamlessly and effectively while operating in a remote work environment. Furthermore, it brought in new funding throughout the year which helped to continue its mission and helped support graduates students and staff no longer fully funded though the state due to budget reductions. It also helped to support CTG’s operational expenses.\nCTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG realized $271,645 in IFR revenue from five RF projects and $966,875 from five state-site MOUs and contract. Combined, overall revenue for CTG FY 2020-2021 was $1,238,520 which helped to support annual operating expenses of $527,447 per year. \nThe expense categories included facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, and utilities for nine months), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online conferences, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,700. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. \nCTG’s PSR state allocation of $922,532 supported 9 FTEs at the start, but with two retirements and one promotion to an external department, support was reduced by 1.6 FTEs to 7.4 FTEs. One FTE was lost and the remaining payroll of .6 FTE is now supported through a CTG IFR account. The remaining current state allocation is $818,022. \nTotal budget reductions this year included $58,093 (line 04496) and $37,560 (line 14824), totaling $95,653 returned to the state. PSR line 04496 (Krumm-Schwan) changed from $119,113 to $61,020 used to fund a portion combined with funding from 900309 of $13,980 to meet the  $75,000  salary for the promotion of Susan Gushlaw into Director of Finance and Administration. The balance of PSR on line 04496 of $58,093 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. PSR line 14824 (Costello) will change from $90,580 to $65,000. PSR will support $53,020 of the salary for positon of Lead Programmer with combined funding from 900309 of $11,980. The balance of PSR online 14824 of $37,560 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. CTG plans to utilize IFR funds to hire a Research Post Doc and a Business Analyst to cover lost positions in this and the last FY.\nCTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $778,005 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures award for $310,645 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation award for $30,824. Total new state awards equaled $341,469. New awards through the Research Foundation included The Political Economy of interoperability funded through the Inter-American Development Bank for $40,951. Also, work began on the Social Determinants of Health: Differential Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York State COVID19 MHD award amounting to $354,634. This was allocated through authorization of the NYS Governor’s Office. Total New RF awards equaled $395,585. \nIn addition, CTG has two proposals and one contract pending including the Public Libraries as Catalysts in Local and Regional Innovation Ecosystems submitted to the Institute of Museum and Library Science for $451,901. Also submitted was a proposal to FEMA, in coordination with CEHC, for $1,007,198 (CTG Portion). CTG is also awaiting confirmation of funding through the City of Schenectady for the Enabling the Statewide Rollout of the Shared Information Resource award for $189,462.Total potential revenue for the coming fiscal year totals $1,648,561.\nResidual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support a Post Doc to help fill the gap left by the loss of the FTE in the Research Division, as well provide funding for a Business Analyst to make up for the loss of an FTE in a similar position in FY 2019-2020. Due to the current fiscal climate, this funding will also support state MOUs and contracts that will require a 20% holdback until revenue from the sponsor is fully realized. \n","stateHeadcount":"12","rfHeadcount":"1","stateNumber":"9","rfNumber":"0.17","additionalAmount1":"271645","additionalSource1":"910029-00 ","additionalAmount2":"966875","additionalSource2":"900309-00","additionalAmount3":"6421","additionalSource3":"20-50013-00 ","federalApplicationsGoal":"2","privateApplicationsGoal":"3","stateApplicationsGoal":"1","federalApplicationsActual":"2","privateApplicationsActual":"5","stateApplicationsActual":"3","federalAwardsGoal":"1","privateAwardsGoal":"2","stateAwardsGoal":"1","federalAwardsActual":"0","privateAwardsActual":"4","stateAwardsActual":"3","lsProposalsGoal":"1","lsProposalsActual":"1","lsAwardsGoal":"1","lsAwardsActual":"0","sttrProposalsGoal":"0","sttrProposalsActual":"0","sttrAwardssGoal":"0","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"0","booksAuthoredActual":"2","bookChaptersGoal":"N/A","bookChaptersActual":"0","publicationsGoal":"N/A","publicationsActual":"35","listOfPublications":"1.\tPardo, Theresa, John Gilligan, Meghan Cook, Mike Garcia, Stephanie Gass Jackson Koutsos, , Autum Pylant, Managing Cyber Threats through Effective Governance: A Call to Action for Governors and State Legislatures (2020) Albany, NY  (Partnership Center for Technology in Government (CTG UAlbany), Center for Internet Security (CIS), National Governor’s Association (NGA), National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL,\n2.\tCook, Meghan, Theresa Pardo, G.

There continues to be a federal, state, and industry focus on the area of smart cities/communities and investment of information and communication technologies (e.g. machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics) at the local government to help improve government operations and provide public services. Given our expertise and research interest in the policy, management, and technology dimensions of information and technology use by governments at all levels, CTG UAlbany can continue to make significant contributions in this area for next 1-5 years.   \n\nWe continue to see working with state agencies in New York and beyond as another big opportunity to advance our research. As state governments and individual state agencies try to modernize older and legacy information systems and adopt new data management and analysis techniques there is a lot of opportunity to apply CTG UAlbany's existing expertise and conduct new externally funded research in this area.\n\nWe are actively pursuing research project partnerships with faculty and professional researchers at CEHC and ASRC. We see a lot of opportunity to collaborate on policy, technology, and management issues in the emergency preparedness, homeland and cyber security, and weather domains and produce competitive and innovative research proposals. \n","bigChallenges":"Due to professionals staff leaving and difficulty in rehiring due to recent budget constraints, CTG UAlbany has seen a significant decrease in non faculty professional researchers who help manage and provide support to our research and other projects. This is impacting the number and size of projects we can conduct simultaneously. However, we appreciate the VPR's, Budget, and HR's recent support for us to replace our two vacant positions due to retirement. In addition we appreciate their support for us to hire temp service staff with available external funding to support research and other projects. ","resourceNeeds":"CTG UAlbany, with the assitance of UAlbany, successfully moved to on campus space by the end of March 2021. This move will allow us to be closer to our students, fellow faculty researchers, and campus administration. In addition, the space on campus will allow CTG to dedicate more of its external reseach funding dollars to support paid undergradute and graduate interns and assistantships ","strategicSuggestions":"Continue to invest in support for proposal development and pre and post award support in general. Also, we think that it is very important to expand the staff and expertise of the UAlbany technology development office. Resources and expertise in this area are critical to helping CTG UAlbany and other researchers at UAlbany determine if and how their research findings can be protected and commercialized.

As a result of the fiscal challenges created by the pandemic, the University implemented various restrictions, including a budget reduction, spending directives, and a hiring freeze, all which directly impacted CTG. Other challenges for CTG included the disruption of a move from off-campus to a smaller on-campus location which significantly reduced our operational costs, while allowing the university to benefit from an increase in overhead revenue. Three key staff turnovers took place throughout the year and resulted in the loss of 1 FTE in the Research Division. This occurred when our Research Director moved into the Center Director role with no replacement of FTE. CTG adapted to all of these new conditions and continued to work seamlessly and effectively while operating in a remote work environment. Furthermore, it brought in new funding throughout the year which helped to continue its mission and helped support graduates students and staff no longer fully funded though the state due to budget reductions. It also helped to support CTG’s operational expenses.\nCTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG realized $271,645 in IFR revenue from five RF projects and $966,875 from five state-site MOUs and contract. Combined, overall revenue for CTG FY 2020-2021 was $1,238,520 which helped to support annual operating expenses of $527,447 per year. \nThe expense categories included facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, and utilities for nine months), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online conferences, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,700. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. \nCTG’s PSR state allocation of $922,532 supported 9 FTEs at the start, but with two retirements and one promotion to an external department, support was reduced by 1.6 FTEs to 7.4 FTEs. One FTE was lost and the remaining payroll of .6 FTE is now supported through a CTG IFR account. The remaining current state allocation is $818,022. \nTotal budget reductions this year included $58,093 (line 04496) and $37,560 (line 14824), totaling $95,653 returned to the state. PSR line 04496 (Krumm-Schwan) changed from $119,113 to $61,020 used to fund a portion combined with funding from 900309 of $13,980 to meet the  $75,000  salary for the promotion of Susan Gushlaw into Director of Finance and Administration. The balance of PSR on line 04496 of $58,093 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. PSR line 14824 (Costello) will change from $90,580 to $65,000. PSR will support $53,020 of the salary for positon of Lead Programmer with combined funding from 900309 of $11,980. The balance of PSR online 14824 of $37,560 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. CTG plans to utilize IFR funds to hire a Research Post Doc and a Business Analyst to cover lost positions in this and the last FY.\nCTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $778,005 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures award for $310,645 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation award for $30,824. Total new state awards equaled $341,469. New awards through the Research Foundation included The Political Economy of interoperability funded through the Inter-American Development Bank for $40,951. Also, work began on the Social Determinants of Health: Differential Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York State COVID19 MHD award amounting to $354,634. This was allocated through authorization of the NYS Governor’s Office. Total New RF awards equaled $395,585. \nIn addition, CTG has two proposals and one contract pending including the Public Libraries as Catalysts in Local and Regional Innovation Ecosystems submitted to the Institute of Museum and Library Science for $451,901.

One full-time research facilitator and one part-time IT support person are supported by the VPR.\nPost-docs, research scientists, visiting scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students are primarily paid from research grants; some are supported from start-up funds provided to SUNY2020 faculty. Most ASRC faculty are on 9-month academic year appointments and are paid summer salary from research grants or start-up funds.\nOTPS:\nASRC’s operations, including operations at the UAlbany location and at Whiteface Mountain, are covered by IFR revenue recovered from sponsored programs. Over the past five years, ASRC’s OTPS expenditures at the Albany location have totaled $202,696, an average of $40,539 per year. Not counting annual telephone charges of almost $19,000 per year, OTPS expenses at ASRC average about $21,539 per year. The Whiteface location’s OTPS expenditures over five years total $77,606, an average of $15,521 per year.\nOne faculty member had a legacy IFR account that covered some OTPS expenses such as Verizon Wireless.\nStrategic Investment:\nIn the past, ASRC has received overhead recovery from the VPR to be used to grow research activity at ASRC. We have about $70,900 remaining in cash to spend on the state-side. On the RF side there is a legacy overhead recovery account primarily used in support of our RF p-card program as the initial source to pay the Bank of America bill monthly; expenses are then moved to the appropriate sponsored award through a reconciliation process.\nEvents:\nASRC has both UAlbany Foundation funds in the Ray Falconer Endowment and UAS (Auxiliary Services) funds to support lectures and colloquies.\n","stateHeadcount":"22","rfHeadcount":"68","stateNumber":"20.68","rfNumber":"51.65","additionalAmount1":"0","additionalSource1":"","additionalAmount2":"0","additionalSource2":"","additionalAmount3":"0","additionalSource3":"","federalApplicationsGoal":"24","privateApplicationsGoal":"10","stateApplicationsGoal":"6","federalApplicationsActual":"24.2","privateApplicationsActual":"5","stateApplicationsActual":"1","federalAwardsGoal":"20","privateAwardsGoal":"6","stateAwardsGoal":"7","federalAwardsActual":"10","privateAwardsActual":"2","stateAwardsActual":"4","lsProposalsGoal":"2","lsProposalsActual":"2","lsAwardsGoal":"0","lsAwardsActual":"1","sttrProposalsGoal":"1","sttrProposalsActual":"0","sttrAwardssGoal":"0","sttrAwardsActual":"","booksAuthoredGoal":"0","booksAuthoredActual":"0","bookChaptersGoal":"0","bookChaptersActual":"0","publicationsGoal":"40","publicationsActual":"73","listOfPublications":"1.\t8/2020: *Osei, M., L.

The workshop was designed around obtaining information to prepare a proposal for a 5-year NSF mid-scale research infrastructure grant, which are solicited every two years.  The purpose of this effort is to kickstart a major reinvestment in the WFM infrastructure and instrumentation, and enhance national and international collaboration. Two initial attempts for this research support have been unsuccessful but we intend to try again in ~1.5 years.\n50th Anniversary: Plans continue for the 50th Anniversary celebrations and related activities, postponed last year due to COVID. In conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the summit observatory we continue to plan for major upgrades of our electrical systems as well as a roof replacement project underway. To celebrate the anniversary we have planned the following so far:\n•\tThere will be a 50th anniversary presentation as part of the Summer Falconer Science and Natural History lecture series recounting the construction, recent upgrades as well as the environmental monitoring and research projects taking place at the site.\n•\tWe are planning to hold a student symposium and banquet to commemorate the anniversary as conditions allow; ideally in Fall 2021.\n•\tWe will create the planned whitepaper before the symposium.\n\nThe EIP Search committee met frequently during this period.

This included active development of software and ML models. Further, the lab is currently in the process of a major software/hardware restructuring due to transitions to the new ETEC building. This restructuring will result in a unified clustering of resources designed to improve access to multiple resources from a single platform and increase the efficiency/utility of all GPU/CPU/Viz machines. A great deal of time has been spent in the design of the new lab/infrastructure, including optimization of networking and connectivity. This work continues to be ongoing, as ETEC construction and shipping delays/issues require continuous intervention. \n\nIn addition to the above, much of the year has been spent in the training of students/postdocs/users in xCITE software best practices, and optimum utilization of resources (e.g., Docker, SLURM, Jupyter, GitHub). Additionally, an abundance of time has been spent working with the Office of Internal Control and the Research Foundation to secure, maintain, and improve the xCITE S&F invoicing account.\n\nIf the prior year’s goals were not met, indicate the challenges and steps taken to ensure success in meeting the goals for the upcoming fiscal year:\nNatural collaborations have emerged from existing projects. This will evolve into the development of a campus-wide AI group, which will become a greater focus once the current priority tasks (ETEC transition, etc) are complete. With regard to products, many current projects are underway and will lead to final software products (dashboards, etc) as well as publications and other presentations of results.\n","noteworthyResults2":"Publications:\nNinneman, M., J.
