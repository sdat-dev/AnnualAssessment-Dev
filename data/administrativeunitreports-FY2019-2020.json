Based on the number of proposals submitted by a faculty member over the previous 24-months, nineteen researchers were given “medallions” worth $15K, $7.5K, and $5K. They were encouraged to formulate small group interdisciplinary research projects and submit extramural grant proposals. Four white papers emerged from this effort. They were provided funding and are currently working on preparing proposals, the target date of which has now slipped due to COVID-19.; In coordination with SUNY central office, oversaw the Germination Space program on Internet of Things at UAlbany campus.
