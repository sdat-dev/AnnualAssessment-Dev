with the LSRB/RNA Institute: The RNA Institute recently acquired a 10x genomics instrument for single cell sequencing. The LSRB also has an imaging core. There is a strong possibility of funds available for purchase of a Nextseq 2000 sequencer. If the CFG could be moved to the LSRB, co-location can enable us to venture in to new areas such as Spatial transcriptomics which combines single cell, imaging and NGS as is gaining fast popularity. Investigators can also think about multi-omic approaches to science.\nPartnering with ETEC: Joint partnership with the Dept. Environmental & Sustainable Engineering will enable us to target funding opportunities for Metagenomics.","Q152":"1. Our instrumentation is aging and needs upgrading/replacement\n2. Our current operational models are in need of revision: (a) CFG needs to be added to grant funding proposals we support more regularly. (b) Currently it takes a lot of time and effort to track payments between RF, State to reconcile with our own records that are more up to date. (c)Deficit funding does not allow us to forecast our future budgets effectively.\n3. There is no marketing or advisory support for our services.

We hope this will result in more applications to NICHD and more funded applications.","Q81_6":"CSDA provided support to Cornell University's population center in developing their portion a larger NIH R25 program called \"Next GenPop,\" which aims to significantly increase the pipeline of scholars from underrepresented backgrounds entering population science. The first five-year funding cycle of NextGenPop will likely be funded by NICHD (its impact score was a 14) and will include five sites -- Wisconsin, Cornell, Duke, UC-Irvine, and Minnesota. When the funding comes through, CSDA will collaborate directly with Cornell in two ways: 1) recruit underrepresented UAlbany students to participate at the Cornell summer program; and 2) CSDA faculty will participate in training and mentoring the students at the summer program. By working with Cornell, in the future funding cycle, CSDA will be competitive to be a host site, which would bring significant visibility to UAlbany's diversity efforts and result in funding from PDB making CSDA competitive for center grant funding. CSDA partnered with the NYS project on COVID-19/MHD, CEMHD, and CURCE on a StAR proposal to develop an infrastructure here at UAlbany to engage underrepresented undergraduates in minority health disparities research. If funded, this would bolster CSDA's chances to be a host site for the NIH R25 proposal and will help CSDA in applying for an NSF grant for Research Experiences for Undergraduates (NSF 19-582).","Q81_7":"CSDA launched a very successful colloquium series this year.

We are the ONLY place on campus at UAlbany where graduate students can analyze these rich, restricted data, which include social, environmental, behavioral, and biological data to examine health and chronic diseases over time of a cohort of over 20,000 adolescents who were in grades 7-12 during the 1994-95 school year and have been followed until 2016-2018 (Wave V). We have recently offered \"cold room\" space to a graduate student from the School of Education so that he can work with restricted data from the Department of Education.

The talk was delivered by Dr. Yao Lu from the Sociology Department and Population Research Center at Columbia University and was on, \"COVID-19, Anti-China Rhetoric, and Anti-Asian Prejudice.\" It was attended by 30 participants. \n\nThese colloquiums were attended by CSDA associates as well as scholars outside of CSDA.","Q106":"Since the micro-sequel event, there have been ongoing discussions with ASRC about collaboration opportunities around examining power outages and the demographics of affected communities. Collaborations among CSDA associates have also begun (e.g., Friedman and Lin) around disaster preparedness of elderly and disabled persons.","Q107":"We plan to continue forging linkages with ASRC and begin to forge linkages with CEHC. We will hold flash talk events among smaller groups of researchers to facilitate their ability to get to know each other's research and highlight emerging funding opportunities.","Q111":"Our third priority is to explore ways to attract students, particularly underrepresented minorities, to engage in population-based research, enhance student experiences of those already engaged in population-based research, and ultimately, through the former endeavors, grow a workforce to assist CSDA associates.","Q112":"We sought to hire work-study students via the federal work study program to work specifically on research with CSDA associates, many of whom are first-generation students and/or from underrepresented minority backgrounds.\n\nWe sought funding opportunities to assist in attracting these students to work at CSDA.","Q113":"-- number of students working at CSDA\n-- applications for funding opportunities","Q114":"FY 2020-2021","Q115":"--We hired three work-study students to work with CSDA Associates on their research.\n--We provided support to Cornell University's population center in developing their portion a larger NIH R25 program called \"Next GenPop,\" which aims to significantly increase the pipeline of scholars from underrepresented backgrounds entering population science. \n--We worked in conjunction with the he NYS project on COVID-19/Minority Health Disparities, Center for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities, and CURCE and submitted a proposal for funding via the UAlbany StAR funding mechanism to set up an infrastructure to mentor underrepresented minority students to work with UAlbany faculty on research on minority health disparities.","Q116":"We hired three work-study students to work with CSDA Associates on their research and two of these students were underrepresented minorities. This provided them with exposure to the research process, and at least one of these students will continue working at CSDA.\n\nThe first five-year funding cycle of NextGenPop will likely be funded by NICHD (its impact score was a 14) and will include five sites -- Wisconsin, Cornell, Duke, UC-Irvine, and Minnesota. When the funding comes through, CSDA will collaborate directly with Cornell in two ways: 1) recruit underrepresented UAlbany students to participate at the Cornell summer program; and 2) CSDA faculty will participate in training and mentoring the students at the summer program. By working with Cornell, in the future funding cycle, CSDA will be competitive to be a host site, which would bring significant visibility to UAlbany's diversity efforts and result in funding from PDB making CSDA competitive for center grant funding. \n\nWe are still awaiting to hear the outcome of the StAR funding.","Q117":"CSDA will continue to work encourage its Research Associates to hire students to engage in their research via the federal work-study program.\n\nCSDA plans to apply for an NSF grant for Research Experiences for Undergraduates (NSF 19-582).\n\nWe will also put in a one-page proposal to Rich Becker and Winsome Foderingham of the Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations to explore fundraising opportunities so that we can hire other underrepresented minority students that do not participate in the federal work study program and to also encourage underrepresented minority students to attend the annual conference of the Population Association of America, the main professional association of population scientists with whom CSDA is affiliated.","Q121":"N/A","Q122":"","Q123":"","Q124":"","Q125":"","Q126":"","Q127":"","Q131":"N/A","Q132":"","Q133":"","Q134":"","Q135":"","Q136":"","Q137":"","Q141":"I provided this last year.

Established in 1993, we pursue new ways to use technology to address practical problems of information management and service delivery in government. CTG UAlbany has collaborated with hundreds of domestic and international researchers on understanding and applying emerging technologies. At the same time, CTG UAlbany has worked with scores of local, state, federal, and international government bodies as a trusted advisor and facilitator of management and policy decisions to govern the use of new technologies as tools for public service transformation.","Q32":"Work with governments worldwide transforming public services through innovations in technology, policy and management.","Q41":"Despite the many challenges resulting from the COVID19 global pandemic, CTG continued to thrive while pursuing its rich and diverse research and project-related activities, working to collaborate with and transform local, state, national, and international governments and communities. As a result of the fiscal challenges created by the pandemic, the University implemented various restrictions, including a budget reduction, spending directives, and a hiring freeze, all which directly impacted CTG. Other challenges for CTG included the disruption of a move from off-campus to a smaller on-campus location which significantly reduced our operational costs, while allowing the university to benefit from an increase in overhead revenue. Three key staff turnovers took place throughout the year and resulted in the loss of 1 FTE in the Research Division. This occurred when our Research Director moved into the Center Director role with no replacement of FTE. CTG adapted to all of these new conditions and continued to work seamlessly and effectively while operating in a remote work environment. Furthermore, it brought in new funding throughout the year which helped to continue its mission and helped support graduates students and staff no longer fully funded though the state due to budget reductions. It also helped to support CTG’s operational expenses.\nCTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG realized $271,645 in IFR revenue from five RF projects and $966,875 from five state-site MOUs and contract. Combined, overall revenue for CTG FY 2020-2021 was $1,238,520 which helped to support annual operating expenses of $527,447 per year. \nThe expense categories included facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, and utilities for nine months), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online conferences, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,700. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. \nCTG’s PSR state allocation of $922,532 supported 9 FTEs at the start, but with two retirements and one promotion to an external department, support was reduced by 1.6 FTEs to 7.4 FTEs. One FTE was lost and the remaining payroll of .6 FTE is now supported through a CTG IFR account. The remaining current state allocation is $818,022. \nTotal budget reductions this year included $58,093 (line 04496) and $37,560 (line 14824), totaling $95,653 returned to the state. PSR line 04496 (Krumm-Schwan) changed from $119,113 to $61,020 used to fund a portion combined with funding from 900309 of $13,980 to meet the  $75,000  salary for the promotion of Susan Gushlaw into Director of Finance and Administration. The balance of PSR on line 04496 of $58,093 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. PSR line 14824 (Costello) will change from $90,580 to $65,000. PSR will support $53,020 of the salary for positon of Lead Programmer with combined funding from 900309 of $11,980. The balance of PSR online 14824 of $37,560 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. CTG plans to utilize IFR funds to hire a Research Post Doc and a Business Analyst to cover lost positions in this and the last FY.\nCTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $778,005 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures award for $310,645 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation award for $30,824. Total new state awards equaled $341,469. New awards through the Research Foundation included The Political Economy of interoperability funded through the Inter-American Development Bank for $40,951. Also, work began on the Social Determinants of Health: Differential Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York State COVID19 MHD award amounting to $354,634. This was allocated through authorization of the NYS Governor’s Office. Total New RF awards equaled $395,585. \nIn addition, CTG has two proposals and one contract pending including the Public Libraries as Catalysts in Local and Regional Innovation Ecosystems submitted to the Institute of Museum and Library Science for $451,901. Also submitted was a proposal to FEMA, in coordination with CEHC, for $1,007,198 (CTG Portion). CTG is also awaiting confirmation of funding through the City of Schenectady for the Enabling the Statewide Rollout of the Shared Information Resource award for $189,462.Total potential revenue for the coming fiscal year totals $1,648,561.\nResidual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support a Post Doc to help fill the gap left by the loss of the FTE in the Research Division, as well provide funding for a Business Analyst to make up for the loss of an FTE in a similar position in FY 2019-2020. Due to the current fiscal climate, this funding will also support state MOUs and contracts that will require a 20% holdback until revenue from the sponsor is fully realized.","Q42_1_1":12,"Q42_1_2":1,"Q42_2_1":9,"Q42_2_2":0.17,"Q43_1":271645,"Q43_1_TEXT":"910029-00","Q43_2":966875,"Q43_2_TEXT":"900309-00","Q43_3":6421,"Q43_3_TEXT":"20-50013-00","Q51_1_1":2,"Q51_1_2":3,"Q51_1_4":1,"Q51_2_1":2,"Q51_2_2":5,"Q51_2_4":3,"Q52_1_1":1,"Q52_1_2":2,"Q52_1_4":1,"Q52_2_1":0,"Q52_2_2":4,"Q52_2_4":3,"Q53_1_1":"1","Q53_1_2":"1","Q53_2_1":"1","Q53_2_2":"0","Q54_1_1":"0","Q54_1_2":"0","Q54_2_1":"0","Q54_2_2":"0","Q61_1_1":"0","Q61_1_2":"2","Q61_2_1":"N/A","Q61_2_2":"0","Q61_3_1":"N/A","Q61_3_2":"35","Q62":"1.\tPardo, Theresa, John Gilligan, Meghan Cook, Mike Garcia, Stephanie Gass Jackson Koutsos, , Autum Pylant, Managing Cyber Threats through Effective Governance: A Call to Action for Governors and State Legislatures (2020) Albany, NY  (Partnership Center for Technology in Government (CTG UAlbany), Center for Internet Security (CIS), National Governor’s Association (NGA), National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL,\n2.\tCook, Meghan, Theresa Pardo, G.

believe that working with local governments in the Capital Region, New York State, and throughout the country as a big opportunity to advance our research. There continues to be a federal, state, and industry focus on the area of smart cities/communities and investment of information and communication technologies (e.g. machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics) at the local government to help improve government operations and provide public services. Given our expertise and research interest in the policy, management, and technology dimensions of information and technology use by governments at all levels, CTG UAlbany can continue to make significant contributions in this area for next 1-5 years.   \n\nWe continue to see working with state agencies in New York and beyond as another big opportunity to advance our research. As state governments and individual state agencies try to modernize older and legacy information systems and adopt new data management and analysis techniques there is a lot of opportunity to apply CTG UAlbany's existing expertise and conduct new externally funded research in this area.\n\nWe are actively pursuing research project partnerships with faculty and professional researchers at CEHC and ASRC. We see a lot of opportunity to collaborate on policy, technology, and management issues in the emergency preparedness, homeland and cyber security, and weather domains and produce competitive and innovative research proposals.","Q152":"Due to professionals staff leaving and difficulty in rehiring due to recent budget constraints, CTG UAlbany has seen a significant decrease in non faculty professional researchers who help manage and provide support to our research and other projects. This is impacting the number and size of projects we can conduct simultaneously. However, we appreciate the VPR's, Budget, and HR's recent support for us to replace our two vacant positions due to retirement. In addition we appreciate their support for us to hire temp service staff with available external funding to support research and other projects.","Q153":"CTG UAlbany, with the assitance of UAlbany, successfully moved to on campus space by the end of March 2021. This move will allow us to be closer to our students, fellow faculty researchers, and campus administration. In addition, the space on campus will allow CTG to dedicate more of its external reseach funding dollars to support paid undergradute and graduate interns and assistantships","Q154":"Continue to invest in support for proposal development and pre and post award support in general. Also, we think that it is very important to expand the staff and expertise of the UAlbany technology development office. Resources and expertise in this area are critical to helping CTG UAlbany and other researchers at UAlbany determine if and how their research findings can be protected and commercialized.","Q155":"","CreateNewFieldorChooseFromDropdown":"","TEST":"","FY2021Mission":"CTG UAlbany – formerly known as the Center for Technology in Government at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany – is a research institute that works with governments worldwide to help transform public service through innovative approaches to, and applications of, technology, management, and policy.

As a result of the fiscal challenges created by the pandemic, the University implemented various restrictions, including a budget reduction, spending directives, and a hiring freeze, all which directly impacted CTG. Other challenges for CTG included the disruption of a move from off-campus to a smaller on-campus location which significantly reduced our operational costs, while allowing the university to benefit from an increase in overhead revenue. Three key staff turnovers took place throughout the year and resulted in the loss of 1 FTE in the Research Division. This occurred when our Research Director moved into the Center Director role with no replacement of FTE. CTG adapted to all of these new conditions and continued to work seamlessly and effectively while operating in a remote work environment. Furthermore, it brought in new funding throughout the year which helped to continue its mission and helped support graduates students and staff no longer fully funded though the state due to budget reductions. It also helped to support CTG’s operational expenses.\nCTG’s revenue stream consists of research grants and awards, corporate sponsored projects, and research agreements supported through the Research Foundation, as well as various University at Albany state and municipal MOUs and contract projects. This year, CTG realized $271,645 in IFR revenue from five RF projects and $966,875 from five state-site MOUs and contract. Combined, overall revenue for CTG FY 2020-2021 was $1,238,520 which helped to support annual operating expenses of $527,447 per year. \nThe expense categories included facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, and utilities for nine months), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, online conferences, and any other non-PSR expense needed to operate CTG. CTG does not receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget. CTG also received an allocation from Rock College to the PSR account in the amount of $18,700. This was used to cover temp salary expenses on our 900309 IFR account. \nCTG’s PSR state allocation of $922,532 supported 9 FTEs at the start, but with two retirements and one promotion to an external department, support was reduced by 1.6 FTEs to 7.4 FTEs. One FTE was lost and the remaining payroll of .6 FTE is now supported through a CTG IFR account. The remaining current state allocation is $818,022. \nTotal budget reductions this year included $58,093 (line 04496) and $37,560 (line 14824), totaling $95,653 returned to the state. PSR line 04496 (Krumm-Schwan) changed from $119,113 to $61,020 used to fund a portion combined with funding from 900309 of $13,980 to meet the  $75,000  salary for the promotion of Susan Gushlaw into Director of Finance and Administration. The balance of PSR on line 04496 of $58,093 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. PSR line 14824 (Costello) will change from $90,580 to $65,000. PSR will support $53,020 of the salary for positon of Lead Programmer with combined funding from 900309 of $11,980. The balance of PSR online 14824 of $37,560 will be used towards CTG’s reduction plan. CTG plans to utilize IFR funds to hire a Research Post Doc and a Business Analyst to cover lost positions in this and the last FY.\nCTG continues to be very strategic with our business development goals and is committed to seeking out new funding opportunities and partnerships. This year, CTG was awarded a total of $778,005 through new State and RF awards. New State MOUs and contract awards included The NYS Board of Elections Futures award for $310,645 and the NYS Board of Elections Local Government Risk Remediation award for $30,824. Total new state awards equaled $341,469. New awards through the Research Foundation included The Political Economy of interoperability funded through the Inter-American Development Bank for $40,951. Also, work began on the Social Determinants of Health: Differential Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York State COVID19 MHD award amounting to $354,634. This was allocated through authorization of the NYS Governor’s Office. Total New RF awards equaled $395,585. \nIn addition, CTG has two proposals and one contract pending including the Public Libraries as Catalysts in Local and Regional Innovation Ecosystems submitted to the Institute of Museum and Library Science for $451,901. Also submitted was a proposal to FEMA, in coordination with CEHC, for $1,007,198 (CTG Portion). CTG is also awaiting confirmation of funding through the City of Schenectady for the Enabling the Statewide Rollout of the Shared Information Resource award for $189,462.Total potential revenue for the coming fiscal year totals $1,648,561.\nResidual funds not utilized in the next fiscal year will be used in the coming years to help continue support a Post Doc to help fill the gap left by the loss of the FTE in the Research Division, as well provide funding for a Business Analyst to make up for the loss of an FTE in a similar position in FY 2019-2020. Due to the current fiscal climate, this funding will also support state MOUs and contracts that will require a 20% holdback until revenue from the sponsor is fully realized.","Q42_1_1":12,"Q42_1_2":0,"Q42_2_1":10.4,"Q42_2_2":0,"Q51_1_1":2,"Q51_1_2":3,"Q51_1_4":1,"Q52_1_1":1,"Q52_1_2":2,"Q52_1_4":1,"Q53_1_1":"1","Q53_2_1":"1","Q54_1_1":"0","Q54_2_1":"0","Q55_1_1":"0","Q55_2_1":"2","Q55_3_1":"14","Q56_1_1":"0","Q56_2_1":"0","Q56_3_1":"0","Q56_4_1":"0","Q56_5_1":"0","Q56_6_1":"0","Q56_7_1":"0","Q57_1":"10","Q58_1_1":1,"Q58_1_2":5,"Q58_1_4":15,"Q58_1_5":0,"Q71":"Engage in innovative research and problem solving projects that address societal challenges","Q72":"Strategically plan for and submit 7 research and other project proposals and contracts","Q73":"","Q74":"","Q75":"CTG Management Team","Q76":"","Q77":"","Q78":"","Q81":"Develop and teach innovative courses that integrate teaching and experiential education\nContinue to design and teach courses as part of the Rock College Information Technology and Management (ITM) Program.","Q82":"Continue to design and teach courses as part of the Rock College Information Technology and Management (ITM) Program.","Q83":"","Q84":"","Q85":"Theresa Pardo, Mila Gasco, and Ramon Gil-Garcia continue to teach courses as part of the Rockfeller College ITM concentration","Q86":"","Q87":"","Q88":"","Q91":"Provide students with internships that allow hands on learning through projects that  address real world challenges and explore and develop innovative and sustainable solutions","Q92":"Provide paid and academic internships for 15 UAlbany students through our Student Innovation Lab Experience (STILE) program and other funded research and projects.","Q93":"","Q94":"","Q95":"CTG Management Team","Q96":"","Q97":"","Q98":"","Q101":"Continue to be global leaders in digital government research","Q102":"Produce 16 high quality academic and practitioner publications based on CTG research.","Q103":"","Q104":"","Q105":"CTG Management Team","Q106":"","Q107":"","Q108":"","Q111":"Continue to be sought after advisers on information policy, management, and technology innovations that advance efforts to  address societal challenges","Q112":"Continue to serve and accept invitations to serve as advisors for local, state, federal, and international government and research groups.","Q113":"","Q114":"","Q115":"CTG Management Team","Q116":"","Q117":"","Q118":"","1819Mission":"","1819Vision":"","1819Goal1":"","1819Activities1":"","1819Metrics1":"","1819Timeframe1":"","1819Goal2":"","1819Activities2":"","1819Metrics2":"","1819Timeframe2":"","1819Goal3":"","1819Activities3":"","1819Metrics3":"","1819Timeframe3":"","1819Goal1:Results":"","1819Goal1:ChangeofPlan":"","1819Goal2:Results":"","1920Goal1":"","1920Activities1":"","1920Metrics1":"","1920Timeframe1":"","1819Goal4":"","1819Activities4":"","1819Metrics4":"","1819Timeframe4":"","1819Goal2:ChangeofPlan":"","1819Goal3:Results":"","1819Goal3:ChangeofPlan":"","1819Goal4:Results":"","1819Goal4:ChangeofPlan":"","1920Mission":"","1920Vision":"","1920Goal2":"","1920Activities2":"","1920Metrics2":"","1920Timeframe2":"","1920Goal3":"","1920Activities3":"","1920Metrics3":"","1920Timeframe3":"","1920Goal4":"","1920Activities4":"","1920Metrics4":"","1920Timeframe4":"","1819Goal5":"","1819Activities5":"","1819Metrics5":"","1819Timeframe5":"","1819Goal5:Results":"","1920Goal5":"","1920Activities5":"","1920Metrics5":"","1920Timeframe5":"","TEST":"","FY2021Mission":"CTG UAlbany – formerly known as the Center for Technology in Government at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany – is a research institute that works with governments worldwide to help transform public service through innovative approaches to, and applications of, technology, management, and policy.
